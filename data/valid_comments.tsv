Beautiful, cozy and classy at the same time, this place is truly recommended for your special days. With 15 percent corporate discounts, you can treat your cotorie well without burning a hole ur pocket. Also, the interior is done so well, you ll love the vibe. On the menu, honey chilli lotus stems, basket biryanis, sizzling brownies were my favourite. Also loved the tomato basil shorba, different from the creamy standards in other restaurants.

Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôàExtensive...Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)The good part! Quantity üòçI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(The breads and raita were decent!The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôàConclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!	3	5/20/2019 0:35	d√©conseill√©	Le Palais des Saveurs	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-06-12	Miso Soup;Spring Rolls;Miso Soup;Spring Rolls	63.57	12	15	Elisa Thomas

My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visitsPanko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.Makhmali Paneer Tikka -Cottage Cheese Shashlik SizzlerItalian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!	4	5/18/2019 14:53	recommand√©	Chez Lucien	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-09-06	Blanquette de lotte;Cr√®me br√ªl√©e	25.16	8	9	Cl√©a Liu

The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.	3	5/18/2019 14:16	d√©conseill√©	La Cr√™perie Bretonne	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-12-27	Brandade de morue;Pho;Pho	59.67	15	18	Ana√Øs Viana

We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.Desserts are ice cream and jamun.The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.Veg spring rolls were too good.Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇKadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.	3	5/16/2019 7:13	d√©conseill√©	Pizzeria Bella Napoli	Hospitality and service: 2	2020-05-15	Penne all'Arrabbiata	26.42	15	18	Clara Ho

Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food.	5	5/15/2019 0:17	recommand√©	Le Bistro du Quartier	Hospitality and service: 1	2020-03-13	Tartare de boeuf;Quesadillas	42.41	18	19	Chlo√© Dubois

I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!	2	5/12/2019 8:37	d√©conseill√©	Le Temple de la Wok	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-10-04	Spring Rolls;Kimchi	22.51	12	14	Louis 
I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu.	3	5/12/2019 0:13	d√©conseill√©	Le Bistrot des Copains	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-12-23	Choucroute garnie	7.41	9	10	Baptiste Dubois

"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more."	1	5/11/2019 10:06	√† √©viter d'urgence	Caf√© Rio	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-03-08	Chilaquiles;Chilaquiles;Barbacoa;Tostadas	63.89	18	21	Lucie Mendes

This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.	1	5/9/2019 12:37	√† √©viter d'urgence	La Brasserie Flamande	Hospitality and service: 1	2020-02-01	Sole meuni√®re;Filet am√©ricain	27.31	14	16	Gabriel S√°nchez

Taste: there was huge hype about biryani hence I tried it, didn't find the taste up-to par, not really happy with the food taste.Ambience: the place was well versed but not calming enough to keep you concentrated on food.

Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!Section wise Ratings:Ambience: 3.5/5Staff: 3.5/5Food: 4/5Buffet items: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5	4	5/24/2019 15:09	recommand√©	Le Moulin √† Vent	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-12-19	Souffl√© au fromage	20.36	9	12	Quentin Dubois

I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.	1	5/17/2019 18:43	√† √©viter d'urgence	Cantina del Sol	Hospitality and service: 2	2020-03-22	Mole Poblano;Enchiladas;Cochinita Pibil;Huevos Rancheros	77.13	11	12	Rayan Wang

"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.Dessert: This section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".This place is indeed a foodie's delight."	5	5/14/2019 12:03	recommand√©	La Brasserie Fran√ßaise	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-11-21	Lapin √† la Kriek;Lapin √† la Kriek;Tartare de boeuf	77.21	14	16	Thibaut Marchand
Visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. Awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. Booked table through Zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..I was surprised with a Mother's Day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!	5	5/13/2019 14:45	recommand√©	Caf√© Parisien	Hospitality and service: 3	2020-01-12	Bouef √† la mode;Salade Lyonnaise;Salade Lyonnaise	64.49	9	12	L√©onie Pereira

The waiters literally takes care of you when you are there.Food: nothing great.

I absolutely loved this place. Let me begin how comfortable this place is. The sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. We were served with welcome drinks. Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.Overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues.	5	5/6/2019 12:08	recommand√©	La Maison de la Bi√®re	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-07-03	Salade li√©geoise;Sole meuni√®re	44.63	15	17	Julien Do

I loved the food variety. You will get a lot of variety in snacks here. All are lip smacking I bet. The best thing I liked this place is the people serving here. You'll get to experience that personal touch. With every course of meal they take your feedback on how did you like the food, any changes they can make to improve. You can also come here to celebrate your special occasions, they provide cake and also play music for you. We had Mr. Jayanta as our host. He was super humble and served nicely.

This is one place that provides a very good buffet for the price that you pay. The quality of food is great. They maintain a variety of items across each course.The fish served as a part of starters was the best I had eaten in a very long time.Mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention.The service is good and the staff is courteous too.But sadly, despite giving clear instructions about the celebrations we had planned at the end, they had messed up with making the arrangement for 2 cakes which they had agreed to provide. This was disappointing and could have been avoided.	4	5/4/2019 15:41	recommand√©	Le Lotus Bleu	Hospitality and service: 1	2020-02-25	Gyoza;Gyoza;Tempura;Miso Soup	79.23	20	22	Ana√Øs Pereira

It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.	2	5/1/2019 22:57	recommand√©	Le Caf√© du Commerce	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-01-08	Choucroute garnie;Pain bagnat;Navarin d'agneau	61.12	9	10	Alice Ramirez

Food was nice we have several options for starters, especially I liked fish starters very much. Main course is also very good. Coming to desserts I love the Ice cream they made on the spot.

This place serves buffet for lunch..It is a value for money dine restaurant.Although they claim to be a Mediterranean resto,most of the items served were that of Indian..So , don't go by its name.The service is really good and the chef personally asks your preference and feedback. The complimentary starter can be improved..One thing I liked here is the option for vegetarians.Veg starters were plenty ,be it be live counter or the ones served at table.Cajun potato,corn , pineapple,paneer ,kebab are to name a few.All were good.They serve MOMO ,pasta,pizza too in the counters.Main course was nice too and had good variety of curries.Dessert spread was huge .

Used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city. To my dismay I ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12PM. Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.	5	5/22/2019 19:07	recommand√©	Le Petit Bouchon	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-12-15	P√¢t√© en cro√ªte;Pain bagnat;P√¢t√© en cro√ªte	41.48	16	18	Lola Jackson

It‚Äôs a fact that the entire hyderabad waits for Ramadan just so that they can have haleem and no place better to do that than the king of haleems; shah ghouse.Tip: ask the person to get you a no added oil haleem and trust me, it tastes much better.

Always the best... The taste of the biryani is so unique that I can close my eyes, taste the biryani and tell that it's Shah Ghouse Biryani....I deducted one point for the behaviour, which could have been better. Not pointing towards any specific scenario but I would prefer ordering online from Shah Ghouse than going there and eating, specially when I am late.The quality sets it apart from its competition. It is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime ...I judge a restaurant by its consistency and Shah Ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality.	4	5/19/2019 14:16	recommand√©	Le Bistrot du Coin	Hospitality and service: 5	2020-03-10	Galette compl√®te	29.48	9	10	Ana√Øs Durand

I have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and I have never been so upset. Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time.

I visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on Zomato. Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.I would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone.	2	4/7/2019 2:05	d√©conseill√©	La Friterie Belge	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-04-24	Anguilles au vert	16.23	16	17	Sarah Flores

"Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.Ambiance=========Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.Service=========The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.Food=========Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.Value for Money============All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.Lets calculate,Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25Final Thoughts=============If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must!

I had heard a lot about this place so I went there. The dining area was pretty jammed and there seemed a lot of dirt lying around like used napkins, food etc. I anyway passed it for the fact that the place is all time busy. But then I saw a RAT nibbling on the scattered food. I reported this to the manager and he told me it's okay and 'ek do Galti toh ho jati hai' and they literally forced me to pay for my order which I did not even touch.

The hotel never updates the status of the order. I called Zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order, then the Zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order. Next them mention it will be delivered by 1:11pm but again no update. I called again at 1:15pm to check what happened to the order. They again called the hotel to get an update. Then they mention your food is still getting prepared, its in the kitchen. What the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys don't mind to update or apologize. I asked to cancel the order and Zomato said it can't cancel as it will be waste of food. Great and I am stuck with the hotel's will to deliver it or not.

If trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... This place is a must visit . It's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.If you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work ... This would be the perfect place.	4	5/14/2019 15:36	recommand√©	Le Temple de la Sushi	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-08-30	Tom Yum	13.56	10	13	L√©on

Been here for the first time. The food and the beer was great. Had ordered the white high pitcher, mutton kheema kothu parotta, basil chicken tikka and three cheese mushroom. The beer had a hint of citrus and a subtle sweet taste. The kothu parotta was a melt in the mouth delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The mushroom was crisp and served as the crunchy element. Our table incharge Keshav ensured that our orders were on time and we had a pleasant experience. Kudos to him. I highly recommend the place for the food, beer and ambience.	5	5/2/2019 4:49	recommand√©	Ristorante Amici	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-12-12	Spaghetti alla Carbonara;Spaghetti alla Carbonara;Risotto ai Funghi	64.87	17	20	Alexandre Martins

Decent place. We went there on a Saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid, this one didn't let us down. We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!Ambience - 3.5/5Food - 4/5Price- 3.5/5Service- 5/5	4	4/30/2019 22:54	recommand√©	Le Bistrot Asiatique	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-07-12	Satay;Ramen;Pad Thai;Pad Thai	87.33	11	13	Arthur Morales

Actually I struggled between 3 and 4 for this place, where drinks are so good and buffet doesn't last to it. But a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. A little costly. Caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though. Finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive	4	4/30/2019 0:49	recommand√©	Le Bistrot des Copains	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-09-10	Cr√®me br√ªl√©e;Clafoutis aux cerises;Choucroute garnie;Choucroute garnie	96.07	8	9	Mathilde Monteiro

Ambience of the place is amazing with good music. They have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. All options are good. Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.If you are in Hyderabad, I will highly recommend to visit this place.	4	4/28/2019 10:43	recommand√©	Le Petit Bistrot	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-09-11	Brandade de morue;Canard √† l'orange;Brandade de morue;Tournedos Rossini	77.1	8	9	L√©onie Ramos

The place and ambience was good.Only sour point was our waiter Kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated (maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well).I had Zomato gold membership and showed him the same.Instead of taking a photo of the same,he started surfing the phone. When I objected,he denied checking the phone. Though the food and place was good,the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude, which cost the two stars.	3	4/26/2019 12:29	d√©conseill√©	Caf√© Rio	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-08-05	Fajitas	16.16	20	21	Arthur Garnier

Special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare. Dinner last night at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf was one such memorable experience. Spread across an acre, with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast. We choose to sit in one of the Mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture.Now coming to the food, started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar. Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times. Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. The setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us.

"On a Sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. So the first name that came to my find was ""Fisherman's Wharf"". On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!Ambiance===========At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""Panjim"" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.Service===========As we were seated indoors at the ""Panjim"" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.Food===========Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.Value for Money=============Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.Lets calculate,Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375Final Thoughts============= If you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad."	4	5/20/2019 10:28	recommand√©	La Trattoria	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-07-10	Arancini;Caprese (Insalata Caprese);Curry Laksa;Cannelloni alla Fiorentina	25.86	11	13	√âl√©a Fonseca

One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food.

Goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. Great place to chill all around the day. The price is a bit on the higher side.Ordered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.Tried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.They offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket.

Excellent ambience, great food and service... There starters, desserts and mocktails are absolutely delicious. The main course is above average. That's what makes this place a 5 star fine dining restaurant. They have different sections both open and covered and named under Goan beaches.

Goan food at its best! This place is as good as it's sister outlet in Goa. Mimicking the Goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.The food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.Must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)Would give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!	4	5/14/2019 8:44	recommand√©	Le Caf√© des Artistes	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-09-20	Poulet basquaise;Clafoutis aux cerises;Clafoutis aux cerises	82.22	9	12	L√©ane Vincent

Good for a nice Sunday brunch. The buffet for two is 1500 INR, and worth the deal, I'd say. The ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options.

This place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa, sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling. Designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. Different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. We had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.Mushroom tonak and Mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. It is the place if u want to try goan cuisine.	5	5/8/2019 18:20	recommand√©	Caf√© Parisien	Hospitality and service: 3	2020-02-27	Fondue savoyarde;Pain bagnat;Galette compl√®te	71.62	10	12	L√©onie Lefevre

Ya i Started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.This hotel is famous for sea food.Thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in India too.I felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.This hotel gave a Goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.The waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.Ambience 5/5Food 5/5Service 5/5Cost is resonable.	5	4/28/2019 17:52	recommand√©	Le Bistrot de Li√®ge	Delivery: 1	2020-04-09	Gaufres de Li√®ge;Gaufres de Li√®ge;Boulets √† la li√©geoise	27.27	12	13	Romain S√°

Went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet. The place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either AC or outside. because of the heat we went inside. The starters and soup were served on the table. There were numerous starters and it was very good. the starters actually make you full. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated. the main course was good and there was a huge spread there. the best part was the desserts which were awesome. Next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience.	4	4/27/2019 9:12	recommand√©	Le Jardin des D√©lices	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-09-23	Pho;Tom Yum;Pho	69.39	18	21	Cl√©ment Sousa

"#6packfoodie goes The Fisherman's Wharf!Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)Ambience: 5/5Courtesy and staff: 1/5Zomato gold experience: 1/5When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.Peace‚úåüèª"	3	4/21/2019 10:40	d√©conseill√©	El Mariachi	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-09-09	Carnitas;Chiles en Nogada;Chiles en Nogada	48.64	10	11	In√®s Huang

Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.Ambiance - 5/5Service - 4/5Food - 5/5Value for Money - 4/5	4	4/7/2019 23:18	recommand√©	L'Auberge Proven√ßale	Hospitality and service: 2	2020-01-29	Quesadillas;Quesadillas	27.48	13	16	Gabin Borges

Situated at end of the city. Very Spacious and Ambience makes us feel like it was in Goa ! Theme restaurant like a fisherman's place ! Number of sea food items available! We can select a fish and make them prepare in customisation way ! We visited for a friend's party , ordered many items but we are not satisfied with the taste ! Soup tasted so bad ! Prawns and Fish items are not so much tasty ! Potato Starter was good ! Squats in fish was good !

This place is a paradise for seafood lovers especially it gives you the look and feel of the west coast. The ambience is something you can get no where in Hyderabad. A Goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too. It is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money. The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers. Their service is very friendly. They do have valet and ample parking space. I have visited this place twice and I am so in love with the food and the ambience.	5	3/24/2019 15:45	recommand√©	La Maison du Sushi	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-07-08	Nasi Goreng;Boulettes √† la sauce tomate;Sushi;Tempura	91.5	9	10	Nina S√°nchez

The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you‚Äôre interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children.

Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.Fisherman's wharf- such a disappointment.	1	3/19/2019 22:30	√† √©viter d'urgence	Le Bistrot des Copains	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-05-16	Bouef √† la mode	9.41	9	10	Cl√©ment Legrand

I had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night, while we were driving along the Financial District road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work. As we entered the place, I was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating. The place was already full by 9p.m., but we couldn't resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood. Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you Goa trips.	5	3/17/2019 12:01	recommand√©	Osteria Italia	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-04-06	Vitello Tonnato;Ossobuco alla Milanese;Ossobuco alla Milanese	24.96	16	19	 Guerin

Sea food cravings. Close your eyes and reach this place in Hyderabad. A very wide spread variety of sea food. Can't pen it here coz you have to visit here. I have always been here for the love for 2 things. Crabs and only crabs. It is a must try speciality of the restaurant. The Goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied. Thats the fun of it. Ambience awesome . Staff too good. Feels homely.

Ambience is really good. Lot of space, laid back ambience, mist sprays - perfect for a lazy Sunday lunch! Coming to food, recommend trying only Goan cuisine. Didn‚Äôt feel the Buffet was special or so but their Ala Carte is real good. Sea Devil is a starter that stands out - prawns wrapped in Beacon, perfectly grilled. Butter Garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side. Goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice - Chicken Vindalho if you are looking for spicy or Chicken Xacuti if you want something less hot!	5	3/11/2019 13:38	recommand√©	Le Cercle des Gourmets	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-06-28	Chicons au gratin;Lapin √† la Kriek	18.63	13	14	Noah Figueira

For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat.fit which has 450Kcal (as mentioned).Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box. Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil. Chapatis were homely, soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad. A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier. Not sure if I would order this again, but could maybe try their salads.	3	4/18/2019 11:28	d√©conseill√©	Le Bistrot du Coin	Delivery: 4	2019-05-29	Tournedos Rossini;Fondue savoyarde;Cr√®me br√ªl√©e;Cr√®me br√ªl√©e	31.57	11	13	Ana√Øs Pereira

Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.	2	4/8/2019 21:58	d√©conseill√©	Le Bistrot de Li√®ge	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-04-15	Moules-frites;Carbonnade flamande;Carbonnade flamande;Gaufres de Li√®ge	51.95	11	12	Camille Hern√°ndez

Everybody is talking about Eat Fit these days! I was curious to know what's causing so much buzz? So, I ordered Chef's Special Veg Thali.It contained 3 wheat flour rotis, paneer ki sabzi, daal makhni, salad, pickle, and a healthy dessert!I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.Overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. You get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. You can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.It's great to see that people are so health conscious now. Eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution.

They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food.	1	3/11/2019 0:10	√† √©viter d'urgence	La Taverne du Chevalier	Delivery: 3	2019-10-20	Sole meuni√®re;Sole meuni√®re;Boulets √† la li√©geoise	68.8	18	19	Gaspard Vieira

I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli. I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 1) They do not use any processed ingredients 2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 3) They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 4) NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 5) Daily Cooking (They cook a limited number of portions )and there are various other reasons as well The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni, Nilgiri Chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken, Mangalorean Chicken, Kashmiri Chicken, Tawa Subzi, Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few. Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. The healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, Wheat Chicken Momos, Chicken Baida Roti are filling. These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.The only downside for me is that it's a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato. They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed Verdict Taste 4.5/5Packaging 4/5VFM 4.5/5Overall 4.5/5Zomato Delivery - 1/5	4	3/9/2019 17:45	recommand√©	Le Bistrot de Li√®ge	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-12-07	Moules-frites	16.61	13	15	Paul Nguyen

Ordered the paneer-dal combo for 2 people. It comes well packed in a big box. The quantity of the food is great! 3 chapatis for a person, raita, dal makhni, paneer, salad, pickle and super food supplement. We also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake. So in terms of quantity a 5/5. Coming to the taste - The paneer was soft, the curry was well cooked and was tasty. Dal was decent, probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind, wasnt high on spices or oil. The curd was fresh and good in taste as well!

I bought food from them twice. Rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma. Both were good and tasty. I liked the Libby shawarma more and the Rumali was also good but Libby better. The Rumali was fat shawarma (means the shawarma was mota) the only concern I had was there was a lot of coriander leaves. I should have given instructions. The taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. Except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well.

One of my chauffeur in Hyderabad recommended this place for authentic Persian food. And I was disappointed. This place didn't live upto the fame and name. The meat wasnt well cooked. The taste was bland. The service was fast, however the quality of service was a disappointment. A cold finger bowl at the end made it worst. Ambiance 0/5, service 2.5/5, staff 3.5/5, food 1/5, value for money 1.5/5.	2	3/8/2019 17:03	d√©conseill√©	La Maison du Sushi	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-05-26	Tempura;Biryani;Tempura	62.48	8	10	Louna Anderson
This place promises to be one of the good Shawarma outlets in Gachibowli. Drive down there for Shawarma is too much of an ask considering the traffic and the parking hassles. So sit back and order online. My order contained 1 Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma and I have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more. Filled with Hummus and the chicken was just cooked right. It is surely at par with the Shawarma served at Shahi Dastarkhwan, Lakdi Ka Pul. The search for a still better Shawarma continues. My 5 Star rating is still pending for the best Shawarma.	4	3/5/2019 12:29	√† √©viter d'urgence	La Friterie Belge	Hospitality and service: 2	2020-02-19	Waterzooi de poulet;Boulets √† la li√©geoise	44.71	16	17	Julien Do

Every foodie I met in Hyderabad recommended this Shawarma. I had just started loving the one from Istah's, but I'm up for a new challenge. My friend ordered one and we shared. It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite.

A very popular shop nearby the hotel I was staying in Gachibowli. Just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big Shah Ghouse complex housing the restaurant, pan shop, tea shop and this Shawarma joint. Lot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before. This was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy. Don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  A somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack.	4	12/4/2018 10:52	recommand√©	Sushi Zen	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-06-03	Kung Pao Chicken;Laksa	49.05	17	20	L√©ane Torres

Waah! kya shawarma man!Really succulent chicken, sweet, flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti. This is a full-sized dinner-replacement wrap that's bang-on with the flavours. The only shawarma in the twin-cities worth craving for. Do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life, let it be this and thank me later.P.S.

Chicken inside the Shawarma got spoiled and smelling too.. Once opened it and was smelling spoiled.. Before ordering only I thought they might use left off chicken as this is afternoon time... But due to the trust on shah Ghouse ordered it.. And initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it.. I last order I thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday I ordered shawarma and he repeated the same..

Man this place. Hyperlocal is one of the go to places when you have no plans but wanna go to some place to chill, eat and drink.The food is served in matte black plates which is my favourite part.We tried almost everything on the menu (perks of zomato gold) and nothing really was a disappointment.The place looks amazing and has a cost feel. They have a setup on the balcony from where the view is just amazing.	4	5/25/2019 13:03	recommand√©	La Brasserie Flamande	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-08-20	Boulets √† la li√©geoise;Pot-au-feu	26.71	15	18	Lison Silva

Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.When it comes to food.First dish was :Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth. Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry. Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area.	4	5/14/2019 20:19	recommand√©	L'Auberge Proven√ßale	Hospitality and service: 1	2020-01-26	Cr√®me br√ªl√©e;Poulet basquaise;Poulet basquaise;Clafoutis aux cerises	58.33	13	16	In√®s Costa

Pathetic restuarant. I had to struggle even for getting a table. Once you pay cover charge you are on your own to struggle. They messed up with everything. I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience. I wasted my money time and energy.	1	5/12/2019 13:53	√† √©viter d'urgence	Le Dragon Rouge	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-09-23	Pad Thai;Pad Thai	35.31	18	20	Paul daSilva

I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time. One good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through Zomato gold. The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service.Also the live music there wasn't great.	3	5/4/2019 20:00	recommand√©	Le Petit Belge	Hospitality and service: 3	2020-01-09	Moules-frites	11.31	14	15	Louis Monteiro

All services delayed, menu changes, very limited options in snack and food when asked they say it‚Äôs menu from Delhi and can‚Äôt help. Inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table. Asked for French fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in. Ok last one came finally when THE MANAGER arrived after being aggressive. They want to offer free drinks but it‚Äôs not about money but experience, will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back.	1	5/3/2019 23:19	√† √©viter d'urgence	La Belle √âtoile	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-03-28	Galette compl√®te	18.02	13	16	Rapha√´l Chevalier
"This was my second visit to the place and I am very disappointed for the following reasons:1) The first time I visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issueI dicided to give it another shot and came again.2) Ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be ""Bollywood Hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.PS: If you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good DJ.

Pathetic experience I have had in recent times. Arrived for buffet at 2pm I. Saturday afternoon. The food was cold as ice, no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customers.The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.Will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.Really disappointed	1	4/28/2019 17:27	√† √©viter d'urgence	El Rancho	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-06-27	Cochinita Pibil;Guacamole;Fajitas	72.98	13	16	L√©a Smith

"Review :Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:Full BarNightlifeLive MusicPrivate Dining Area AvailableWi-FiLive Sports ScreeningIndoor SeatingSmoking AreaBuffetIf you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance."	5	4/24/2019 17:23	recommand√©	Le Caf√© du Commerce	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-07-12	Choucroute garnie;Navarin d'agneau;Cr√®me br√ªl√©e	46.65	11	14	Evan Ramirez

"Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are ""fancier than you are"". üòéüòâüôÇI ordered for üçÖüç∏ Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick üôÉüòúü§™ in first sip itself. The üçë üç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and üçÑ mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread üçû üòã.It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts."	4	4/23/2019 21:43	√† √©viter d'urgence	Pizzeria Bella Napoli	Hospitality and service: 4	2020-03-21	Risotto ai Funghi;Penne all'Arrabbiata;Caprese (Insalata Caprese);Risotto ai Funghi	79.54	16	18	Zo√© Brown

Food - 4/5Ambience - 3.5/5Service - 1/5I visited the place last week. The food was tasty and so was ambience but I have serious concern with the services.We asked for regular water , and they brought dirty, stinky water just to sell the bottled water. The waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for free.It was highly irresponsible.Also we had to literally beg them to bring the cheque.Please train your staff if you want to .	2	4/20/2019 16:10	d√©conseill√©	La Cucaracha	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-05-18	Tacos al Pastor;Carnitas;Sopes;Fajitas	67.3	13	15	Laure Thomas

"Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.Be aware people. Avoid this place."	1	4/6/2019 12:16	√† √©viter d'urgence	La Brasserie Fran√ßaise	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-06-03	Spaghetti alla Carbonara	18.27	14	16	Thomas Gautier
The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ‚Çπ 799.They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.The chicken tikka pockets were dry.The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.The music was extremely loud for the place.Overall we had a below average Experience.Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5	3	4/6/2019 0:44	d√©conseill√©	La Maison du Pho	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-06-08	Ramen;Miso Soup;Ramen;Dim Sum	61.9	9	12	Axelle Dubois

Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation.

I had a very experience related to the hygiene of the place. We were in the balcony when we saw cat walk through the separation (it separates balcony from the bar). We told the person serving us and he said that the cat often comes here and does nothing. You don't have to worry about anything. Till that time we had ordered our food. But seeing the cat walk by and no one batting an eye we cancelled the order and walked out.	1	4/1/2019 2:01	√† √©viter d'urgence	Le Moulin √† Vent	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-12-12	Tournedos Rossini;Choucroute garnie;Choucroute garnie;Bouef √† la mode	77.03	9	11	L√©o Ramos

Kulcha pockets filled with chholey.Pesto roast vegetables pizza: A thin crust pizza with adequate amount of toppings.Penne arrabiata ( chicken added separately ): Nice cheesy pasta loaded with vegetables and chicken.Nice ambience and satisfactory service.	4	3/31/2019 23:57	recommand√©	Chez Lucien	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-12-18	Brandade de morue;Poulet basquaise;Cr√®me br√ªl√©e;Cr√®me br√ªl√©e	76.75	10	12	L√©o Lee

Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)	3	3/25/2019 15:50	d√©conseill√©	La Maison de la Bi√®re	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-02-01	Fajitas;Moules-frites	49.63	17	20	L√©na Freitas
"Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.Recommended!!!"	3	3/25/2019 10:29	d√©conseill√©	La Taverne du Chevalier	Delivery: 4	2019-05-22	Carbonnades √† la flamande;Carbonnades √† la flamande;Couques de Dinant;Filet am√©ricain	101.45	18	19	Charlotte Ortega
I tried to visit the place and asked the waiters if we can use the 2+2 on drinks for non alcoholic drinks as well. The waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters. Then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in Hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we don‚Äôt speak Hindi. Of course we left immediately and don‚Äôt think that will ever come back.	1	3/24/2019 22:58	√† √©viter d'urgence	Le Temple de la Wok	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-05-25	Sushi	6.24	12	15	Cl√©mence Ribeira

I am wondering if I had ordered thick shake or an ice cream.. thick shake will have better consistency than this.. most of my previous orders were in the same condition, yet I gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand .. NOT ANY MORE. Spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste.. IF YOU GUYS COULDN'T PROVIDE ICE CREAM IN PROPER WAY THEN PLEASE STOP GIVING HOME DELIVERY.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. I wonder if I can actually call this as an ice cream. Some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... NOT SATISFIED with your ice cream. . Not worth spending a single rupee on this one.I was trying to take a pic and then this happened. I didn't keep pressure while holding. You can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. I didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. Both quantity n quality was not good. I understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate. I place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes. Despite of the distance and presence of dry ice, the ice cream melted completely.	1	2/26/2019 19:30	√† √©viter d'urgence	La Friterie Belge	Hospitality and service: 1	2020-01-13	Moules-frites;Boulets √† la li√©geoise	40.41	16	19	Manon Gomes

Visited this place a while back. Their ice creams are totally worth it! I'd suggest try their listed sundaes rather than make a custom one: the pre-listed choices are just so much better. the only issue is their seating space is a little less, so we took our ice creams to go. But would recommend it just for the taste.	4	1/25/2019 4:32	recommand√©	Pizzeria Bella Napoli	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-08-25	Pho;Pho	39.77	16	17	Adam Zhao

Cream stone is just an amazing place to have some dessert. They have almost all the flavors that you can ask for in icecreams. They have Shakes, Waffles, ice creams, sundaes and what not.The ambiance is good and they have a seating arrangement for about 15 peoples.I tried the Red Velvet and Willy Wonka Icecreams. They are served on a cone which is also very crispy.Willy Wonka is made from Chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. One ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.Must try if you have a sweet tooth!!!	5	12/30/2018 13:50	√† √©viter d'urgence	La Cocina Mexicana	Delivery: 5	2019-09-04	Carnitas;Carnitas;Pozole;Carnitas	44.9	16	18	Margot Tran

The taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts. The next thing that i tried here is the Chocolate overdose.

Sardaarji's Chaats & More serves really good punjabi food. If you want reasonable and tasty punjabi food, this place is a really good option in and around Gachibowli. As the name suggests, they have amazing chaats.I have tried parathas from a lot of places in Gachibowli. And found the perfect places for parathas! But this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. The only problem is the packaging. It's not horrible. You can work with it. But comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.Aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. It was delivered hot and fresh! Papadi with dahi was delicious! The curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. The papadis were very crispy and crunchy. It was topped with green chutney.The quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. So, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.I'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!Since, I never visited this place, can't talk much about the hygiene of this place! But overall, the experience was good.	4	3/14/2019 0:16	recommand√©	Le Palais Imp√©rial	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-01-14	Laksa	11.67	20	22	L√©a Teixeira

This restaurant is famous for quick bites and street food. It is located in Indra Nagar, Gachibowli which is the most accessible place for techies in Hyderabad. This place is little congested and hygiene is not well maintained.We get all kinds of street food like Chaat, Pav bhaji, Paratha, Chole bhature, Rajma Chawal etc. We had chole bhature and this was the best that I had in the recent times. If you want, you can get extra chole curry. And the butter milk and Lassi here has the Punjabi essence in it. You will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with Butter Milk/Lassi.If you're in search of proper north Indian snacks or street food, do visit and try food from this restaurant. The cost in this restaurant is very affordable. For the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable.	4	1/27/2019 4:28	recommand√©	Le Petit Bistrot	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-01-31	Souffl√© au fromage;Tartare de boeuf	25.91	8	11	Antoine Joly

Sardarji's chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in Delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over (for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi).The sandwiches, especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome. The dahi bhalla, dahi papdi's are good too. However, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.Another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes. I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha's from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked.

Located in Indira nagar, This outlet serves chats along with limited tandoor and Punjabi style main course dishes. Ordered paneer butter masala half along with rumali roti and butter naan. Prices were reasonable and pocket friendly. Less than 200 bucks AI.Paneer butter masala was extra tangy, unlike traditional restaurant style dishes. Paneer quantity was very less, 4 small pieces served in a cup of smooth textured gravy. Tandoori items tasted good. Ordered earthen pot cooled milk in the end, with chat masala added, 30 bucks per glass.	3	11/14/2018 0:45	d√©conseill√©	Le Caf√© des Artistes	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-01-14	Clafoutis aux cerises;Penne all'Arrabbiata;Waterzooi de poulet	89.67	8	11	Alexandre Miller

Food quality is good. But not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of BN or ABs. So, it was really disappointing.Also service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. That really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good.

This is an amazing place for Veg as well as Non Veg starters. There are so many varieties in it. As you will be already full, you don't generally go for Main course and also it's very average.

I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together.	3	3/29/2019 17:36	recommand√©	Le Caf√© des Artistes	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-12-01	Poulet basquaise	20.28	8	10	Adam P√©rez

We went to this place as a part of corporate outing. It was my first time to Barbeque Nation. I must admit that I was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction. The starters alone were enough to fill up my belly. When it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, I would say. The waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies.	4	3/3/2019 17:54	recommand√©	Chez Andr√©	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-06-20	Carbonnades √† la flamande	7.82	8	9	Ethan Bernard

Friday afternoon, We planned team lunch (veg & non-veg) in Gachibowli Barbecue Nation. We were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food & variety served was average and wasn't upto standard w.r.t taste & variety.In short, it wasn't value for money. I think it would be better to choose Absolute Barbecue over Barbecue Nation, as customer you get value for money. Seems like now Barbecue Nation is just riding on its legacy.	3	2/8/2019 16:53	d√©conseill√©	Le Bistrot de Li√®ge	Hospitality and service: 4	2020-01-29	Boulets √† la li√©geoise	10.53	11	14	Valentin Moreau

Barbeque Nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts.

We were told that Barbeque Nation is always booked, we tried our luck anyway and got a table for 9:30.From the greeting to serving and the host was so nice...I must give them 5 stars for excellent customer service.The Starters were amazing....I love prawns but it's kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned But their Prawns are the best grilled prawns I ever tasted. They could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine ..... the starters were so yumm that we didn't want to try the main course....

They had chicken tandoori, mutton kebab, veg kebab, American corn, creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff. On the grill they served one variety each of chicken, basa fish, prawn, mushroom, paneer, pineapple. The main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it. The dessert options were sorted and tasty. They had 2 ice cream flavours, Gulab jamun, kheer, brownie, milk cakes, pastries and tarts, 2 kulfi.

We were here to give our treat to a group of friends. What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad.	1	11/29/2018 1:50	√† √©viter d'urgence	Restaurant Sakura	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-01-16	Tom Yum;Sushi	34.81	19	20	Tom Wang

Have visited this place on 2nd October with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. All the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch. Place is not that huge but very well maintained, hospitality is top notch by their staff.Coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. Service was top notch as usual and value for money. This outlet is one the best on in Hyderabad hands down.	5	10/31/2018 1:37	recommand√©	La Table d'Amis	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-01-07	P√¢t√© en cro√ªte;Canard √† l'orange;Fondue savoyarde	70.68	18	19	Nolan Rodriguez

To start with , the complimentary drinks Blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section. I can only rate it 3 for food , 5 for service , 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter.	3	10/14/2018 12:09	d√©conseill√©	Restaurant Tokyo	Hospitality and service: 4	2018-11-20	Curry Laksa	23.35	11	14	L√©on Rodriguez

I almost forgot to write the review as I got too busy until I found these pictures in my gallery. I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That‚Äôs what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. The overall experience was bad, something not expected from a BBQ Nation.	2	10/9/2018 21:06	d√©conseill√©	La Cr√™perie Bretonne	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-06-13	Gratin Dauphinois;Pain bagnat	52.26	16	19	Louise Leroy
This place goes and keeps up with the name! Amazing starters. The chicken kebabs are wonderful. The crispy corn and the Cajun spice potatoes are super duper awesome!! After the rounds of starters,. There wasn't any space for the main course so directly went for desserts. Their in house kulfis are the speciality here. Paan kulfi tastes the best! Gulab jamuns with ice-cream make the perfect combo.	4	9/28/2018 1:27	recommand√©	Le Temple de la Sushi	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-05-12	Tempura;Tempura;Tempura;Miso Soup	87.26	10	13	Juliette Girard

"This was my first time at a ""Barbeque Nation."" I've heard great things about it, people sounded like they serve food from heaven.Now, let me tell you about my experience at this outlet, not going to judge the other outlets. The service was not good, we had to call em' more than thrice to get the starters served, the chicken tasted stale, fish and prawns were amazing though. They were serving complimentary drinks, I selected ice tea, worst one I've ever had.The good thing about this place, their ""manager,"" he knew we weren't happy, tried his best to make things right for us, made the chef come to our table, which felt good and cared for.I liked the ambience of this place, will definitely give another chance to this outlet ‚úåÔ∏è"	3	8/24/2018 19:18	d√©conseill√©	La Taverne du Chevalier	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-01-11	Sole meuni√®re;Boulets √† la li√©geoise	17.9	18	20	L√©on Lopez

Unlimited BBQ food with delicious desserts-Ambiance-Barbeque Nation is located near Wipro Lake exactly beside Deli 9 Bistro. This outlet of Barbeque Nation is quite congested. As it is situated at the Ground floor, indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 8-10 people per table. They play silent English songs in the background.Food-As we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.Service-Service was very quick and the staff was very good. Chef himself came to our table to take the feedback.	4	7/31/2018 23:27	recommand√©	Le Petit Gourmet	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-06-03	Navarin d'agneau	17.32	12	15	 Vincent

Excellent service and food buffet! This place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise. The pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it.Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course.I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else!

More expensive than the other barbecue counterparts but once you experience this place, you will realise why it's worth every penny. From the starters to the main course. Everything was rich in flavour and taste. Softest mutton sheekh kebab ever I tasted here. The menu didn't include mutton keema, yet our waiter Gopal served us some with pav and ghee naan.

It‚Äôs a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation. I should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish, chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention. The main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package. It‚Äôs a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals, birthday celebrations or friends hangout.	4	6/30/2018 14:37	recommand√©	La Taverne du Chevalier	Hospitality and service: 5	2018-11-12	Couques de Dinant;Carbonnades √† la flamande	22.94	17	19	Louna Anderson
We went here from office. A group of 17 members. We were the first so seating was not an issue. I had veg starters and it was marvellous. For once the spice levels matched my lower than normal Hyderabad spice margins. The paneers were too soft for the skewers and kept dropping into the fire. The corn fried were very good. Food was excellent especially the sweet corn soup. Desserts we very good.

Quick review points- slippery floor .. be careful when you good with high heels or children. Perhaps they don't have time to clean it up to reach standards of safe place- bathrooms meant for rotten rats... Dirty washroom and tiny doors. Hefties and jumbo sizes, you can't get in- service ... Ohhh they can't handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up. For sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter, but service time and order time is pathetic.- advance bookings ... They don't understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in- pan kulfi... It should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color.

I have visited barbeque nation multiple times and it has been beyond my expectations every time. I love the items which they keep on their grills especially the non-vegetarian ones. in the non-veg ones I most like their prawns and the fish. I had forgot to mention the service and the ambience. the service is good and even the ambience is great. in of the grill I like the crispy corn and  the and some aloo thing they serve it is always awesome. as we went there on jewel of the sea festival, I had got crab curry (with no flesh in it) and we had butter naan and tandoori roti. crab curry was not so great but nice. the butter naan was great and even the tandoori roti was nice. we even went for curd rice and dal makhni. both of them were nice. my overall experience with barbeque nation was awesome.	4	5/14/2018 9:19	recommand√©	La Friterie Belge	Hospitality and service: 4	2018-12-05	Filet am√©ricain;Anguilles au vert;Anguilles au vert;Boulets √† la li√©geoise	85.81	17	20	Camille Rodrigues
Service was pathetic. Ordered a sizzler with lamb, was told no lamb. Ordered another sizzle with Noodles. It took 15 mins to serve that one. Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup.	2	5/21/2019 21:45	d√©conseill√©	Le Ch√¢teau de Cuisine	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-07-02	Tartare de boeuf	6.85	17	18	Gaspard Do

Visited for lunch today with colleagues and ordered one spicy chicken sizzler combo and two buffets. The buffet comes with veg and non veg sizzler , though without the sides (fries, veggies and noodles/rice). The buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions , perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce.

I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay.

We had a very bad experience here. We have ordered Fish Shashilk and Sizzling Chicken sizzlers. The Fish Shashilk sizzler didn't have fish in it. Upon asking the waiter, he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that I had already not eaten it. He then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. Upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. I had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. Mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. It's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.I would have given one star. But one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler.	2	4/8/2019 23:54	d√©conseill√©	Le Bistrot des Copains	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-11-14	Tartare de boeuf;Choucroute garnie	26.47	10	12	Oc√©ane Thomas

This place is good for a casual lunch and dinner with friends or family. This place offers a wide variety of Sizzlers and other Starters and Main Course as well . During my last 2 visits I‚Äôve tried a non veg Platter, 2-3 different types of non-veg Sizzlers, Tikka Pizza with add-ons like fries üçü n all.While the food they serve is good but they could do better with service.Service isn‚Äôt up to the mark , once your order is taken it‚Äôs lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table (after 20 mins ) and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how‚Äôs the food??!!.

Mostly overratedWent with my wife today by seeing the 3.9 stars. The place is small and too much crowded. There are very less number of servers compared to footfalls. Now coming to food, ordered chicken drumsticks,but taste was not that great then ordered one non veg sizzler which was also not that great. Noodles in the sizzler were tasteless. Overall did not find the experience which we were expecting.	3	3/21/2019 22:37	d√©conseill√©	Le Caf√© de Paris	Delivery: 1	2019-09-12	P√¢t√© en cro√ªte;Gratin Dauphinois;Gratin Dauphinois;Navarin d'agneau	93.99	10	12	Gabriel Guti√©rrez

"I had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce. I wouldn't say it was the worst, but it was not up there. There was no smokiness like the name claimed, just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn't really need to be there in it, in the first place. I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the ""smoked chicken"" needs to be upgraded. The spaghetti was also slightly overcooked."	3	3/19/2019 20:15	d√©conseill√©	Chez Andr√©	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-03-23	Potjesvlees;Tarte au riz	38.74	8	9	L√©o V√°squez

This is what we were served today when we ordered for Grilled Paneer. I think this was someone's left over which we were served. Giving the benefit of doubt that they might have made some mistake, I informed them that it might be a mistake but the manager said that they didn't have enough plated to serve and hence they served it like this. After a lot of arguments they finally decided to change it. BUT the story does not end here. They served us ice cold paneer in a different plate.

It was a night out with gal pals.When we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.Warm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV.They have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. That is what server told us.The server came and took our orders.We ordered starters and drinks.As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.It kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.Other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.Anyways moving onThe cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.The music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.Hope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.Food -3/5Service-3/5Overall experience - 4/5 ( Because of friends)VFM- 3.5/5	3	5/9/2019 13:12	d√©conseill√©	Ristorante Amici	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-09-22	Bruschetta;Fettuccine Alfredo	56.41	18	21	L√©on Ramirez

To enter this bar, you have to go from the main entrance of the mall. There is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear. You may find it little bit awkward.Coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. You better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. We booked in advance but still we didn‚Äôt get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).We ordered Singapore Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Wet and white sauce Pasta.Singapore Noodles - 5/5Mixed Fried Rice - 5/5Chicken Wet - 4/5White Sauce Pasta - 2/5They didn‚Äôt have pizza on the day we went.Music- They played good English songs early and followed by hindi songs. Songs were very good.Drinks - You have to order through their app. So we had to install and order. It was not very convenient. The price of drinks on the menu in Zomato has no relation with the actual price.

Good concept, based on some other existing clubs though. There is a serious need of utilizing the space properly, which at present requires quite some work. Limited dance floor, have to be protected by bouncers, everybody blocks the road after last call but ignoring all that, food is good, Music is good, and projector is okaish.	4	5/5/2019 1:49	recommand√©	La Trattoria	Delivery: 0	2020-02-23	Arancini;Arancini;Penne all'Arrabbiata;Caprese (Insalata Caprese)	65.84	11	12	Nolan Blanc

Bunch of hypocrites. One cannot enter unless they have a girl beside them. One cannot enter unless they have shoes tied to their feet. One cannot enter unless their lower limbs are fully covered (for guys). We pay you to get us drunk,not to judge us based on our footwear and whom we tag along. You think someone without shoes can't behave or pay you the bill?

Service was way too slow. We had to wait 40 minutes for a single dish. The drinks menu (on the app) is good but they never have enough stock so don't even bother going here for drinks. Single guys are not allowed on the dance floor. BBQ chicken wings was putrid. Worst of all? Look at the picture I attached, they cheat you by giving you smaller shot glasses when you're very drunk.

One of the best bars I have visited in Hyderabad so far...It has a quirky concept ofBarExchange.Its a great place to hangout and party with ur friends, has a groovy music and a big dance floor, it also has an option of open air and this place is crowded on weekends.It's all based on the demand and supply that day!A large dynamic trading display board tells you what the current price for various drinks is, and shows you the highest and lowest prices for the day, in real time. All you need to do is download their app, which also shows you the trading board, and use it to place your order.The food is acceptably good and service is quick.	4	4/28/2019 14:35	recommand√©	La Maison de la Bi√®re	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-09-29	Sole meuni√®re	11.4	17	19	Bastien Pereira

I have ordered food couple of times from this place but never been there. Mostly I used to order thali for lunch. Which was worthy. This was my first physical visit to the restaurant. And I was very amazed to see all the glory around me. Ambience, look, coziness and lighting all were so perfect. The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience. Trust me you will never be disappointed after going to this place.Ambience - 4.5 out of 5Food - 4 out of 5 (cost could be lower side slightly)Staff service - 5 out of 5	4	4/28/2019 0:08	recommand√©	Chez Andr√©	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-11-06	Tarte au riz	7.65	8	10	Esteban Duval

Filtered entry - CheckWelcome assistance - CheckCrowd - CheckAmbience - CheckWhat's great? Nothing.It's a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money. Half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and I don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.Overall, I liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night.

Good ambience, good food, good dance place.Three of us girls went to this place on a rainy Friday evening and it turned out to be good fun. We ordered:White sauce pasta: it was awesomely tasty. The sauce was made correctly with the right consistency. There were vegetables in it.Nachos with sauce: again another yummy dish. Though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of Nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.Chicken kebabs: just wow. The best dish of the evening for us. Soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.We also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).It also has a good dance place. Furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.All in all, an awesome experience and I would have given 5 stars, but the pineapple mocktail and the seats that we got inspite of booking in advance made me deduct one star.	4	4/13/2019 7:55	recommand√©	Le Bistrot du Coin	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-05-16	Cr√®me br√ªl√©e;Brandade de morue	20.4	11	14	Cl√©a Garcia

The lal street has a big dancing floor , ambiance is pretty good and has a outside seating area also. It's very crowded on weekends like anythingTalking about the food this place is Zomato Gold Food partner. If you have it , you can enjoy the benefits- Chicken Lolipop, crispy lolipop served with salsa sauce- Masala Papad , stuffed masala papad rolls with coriander chutney and onion- cheesy pineapple sticks (Never ever order this, it was pathetic) :(- Paneer lazeez , creamy tomato onion gravy with cottage cheese (highly recommended)- Chicken Tikka Masala (highly recommended)- Cheese Garlic naan and butter NaanOverall my evening at Lal was just amazing, the service was really good. You can go with your friends and family to enjoy the weekends for sure. #mydj17	4	4/1/2019 14:29	recommand√©	Le Bistrot de Li√®ge	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-06-20	Gaufres de Li√®ge;Carbonnades √† la flamande	35.21	11	12	Marius Liu
This was our second stop in same complex on Saturday (30/03) evening. Only reason I am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by GM of the joint, given below so you guys decide the merits of place.Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla.	2	4/1/2019 11:11	d√©conseill√©	Le Cercle des Gourmets	Hospitality and service: 5	2020-01-31	Pizza Margherita;Chicons au gratin	23.46	14	17	Kylian Wong

First of all special mention to Santosh who really made our evening very best by his great service. He was superb in taking our orders and serving really fast. Thank you Santosh for it.Now coming to F&B, though little priced on high end, it was worth it. Every thing we ordered in Veg, Non Veg and Drinks (Mocktails) we're really good... Music was lovely, ambience was perfect and above all I believe Wednesday is Ladies Night... So all the girls / ladies you know one place to go as well, if you didn't know so far like me... :-)Overall... Very well spent time and gathered loads of memories as always...

Even though this place is huge, we couldn't find a place to sit initially. Around 10.30 we finally got a place to sit. The food and the bar here is good and service was prompt (once you get a table). The DJ played some nice Bollywood songs. Overall it's a nice place but I'd recommend to book a table before you go here if you are planning to visit on weekends.	4	3/27/2019 0:27	recommand√©	Le Comptoir Oriental	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-09-21	Kimchi;Bulgogi;Laksa;Fondue savoyarde	72.54	15	16	Tom Brunet
The DJ who plays at this place is really good. We went in a group of 10 people and enjoyed a lot. On the downside, the food and drinks service is really slow and number of waiters are less as compared to seating strength of the place.The people on bar counter suck big time as they don't talk properly, give you respect and try to loot you by saying half of the low price drinks are not available.	3	3/24/2019 13:34	d√©conseill√©	Le Caf√© du Commerce	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-06-07	Galette compl√®te	20.46	9	10	Enzo Laurent
The Lal Street is been good for the first time. Today I went and booked a table, where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar. Then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us, where there was no-one to entertain us and take our order. We sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order. Then suddenly being Saturday night, the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side. Everyone want their Saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears. No doubt music played by DJ was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor.Food was fine though but ambience is good.	3	3/23/2019 22:30	d√©conseill√©	La Taverne du Chevalier	Delivery: 3	2019-07-11	Boulets √† la li√©geoise;Sole meuni√®re;Filet am√©ricain	53.7	19	20	Thomas Alonso

What an ambience. It was a Saturday evening on which we visited this place.It has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages. We could order ourselves from the app.The Lal Street (to be read as Dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed). In terms of food, we ordered two preparations,Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from Kolkata)If you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR. It's definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food.	4	3/19/2019 9:14	recommand√©	Le Bistrot des Copains	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-04-04	Choucroute garnie	7.41	10	12	Nils Santos

Place was a complete let down. Was there for lunch on Sunday and was disappointed. The veg stack in the western section was actually a spicy paneer which was basically spicy filling between 2 slices of paneer and topped with a chilli sauce. 2 dishes took 40 mins to come while 1 was served in 12 mins. Staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on Saturday. The only saving grace were the drinks. So unless you want to go and just have a drink and then more drinks, skip the place.	2	3/10/2019 16:53	√† √©viter d'urgence	Brasserie de la Gare	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-10-14	Steak frites;Steak frites;Laksa	60.08	17	20	Chlo√© S√°

Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.Coming to the food:Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!	4	5/22/2019 0:10	recommand√©	Le Temple de la Wok	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-09-02	Satay;Kimchi;Satay	34.57	13	15	Nathan Castro

Been here after seeing the rating but somehow disappointed. Starters was okay. Main coourse was very limited, i mean like common fr 700+ bucks dey provide less items. Dessert was good. Mexican fried icecrm was smething i tried fr d first tym but again the menu was limited and the quality of the cakes and pastries was very bad. My frnds nd me too could sense a foul smell as if it was nt fresh. Coming to the special items duck, rabbit squid, quail was on live and the chef cooked all the items in same way in same sauce. So i couldn't just feel the difference between all those special to be dishes. The place is nt properly built as i could smell the smoke of cooking and burning as well. Staff were very courteous and polite.

I had bad experiences at this place multiple times. The management has no sense of customer experience. The people working there dont even respond to customers properly. While ordering, they don't check the inventory. We had to wait for 30 min for order to be served and even after that, there were some items missing. When asked how long it would take, they just responded vaguely.

Don't know what is going wrong with KFC as a brand , they are doing it wrong in every aspect! No proper management of customers on the counters, the food they are serving is not upto the mark as it used to be. I was a fan of KFC, but slowly I am loosing interest in going. I had a very bad experience. The coke they served was very sweet without any soda in it , I though I was having a sweet water. The chicken was not served hot. The quality of the rice they are providing is going down day by day!Management please look into this, or else you will be loosing a lot of patrons.

on March 20th 2019, I've ordered 3 8 piece Smoky Grilled, which is worth of 1,857 rupees through Zomato. Instead of getting three 3 8 piece order, i was only given 2 8 piece order and 1 Hot crispy. I've called the customer care and i was assured call back. But, they didnt. when i've approached Zomato, i was told that there is nothing that they can do about it. Here is the twist of the tale -   instead of refund or replacement, i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits. I would really not recommend orders from this place, as the customer treatment is pathetic. Since this is a corporate order, i strongly recommend my Food committee not to order anything from KFC in bulk.	1.0	3/25/2019 14:11	√† √©viter d'urgence	Cantina del Sol	Delivery: 1	2019-04-10	Huevos Rancheros;Sopes;Huevos Rancheros;Tacos al Pastor	44.790000000000006	13	15	L√©na Mart√≠n

Been there when me and my friend was so hungry after our shopping we ordered a smoky chicken rice bowl. We awaited almost for 35-40 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing. Coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked didn't felt it different. Coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good.	4.0	8/10/2018 14:47	recommand√©	Au Bon Pain	Hospitality and service: 2	2018-11-22	Galette compl√®te;Blanquette de lotte	34.97	10	13	Jules Williams

Nice store outlet of KFC.  Came here for a quick snacks - the usual reason why we all go to KFC's :)I like Zinger burger a lot.  They now introduced a new krunchy Zinger burger (didn't try it as yet).Their choices of krushers is good.

As u can see lot of adds about this..The store is quite neat and clean.. Might be the reason there r only two tables..Staff is quite good ND cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice.. Hash brown potato I did not liked it there was no taste actually.. For my palate.. Coming to üçî burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it's crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it's soft..But over all its good.. Want to give 3.5 buts u don't have option. This box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent.. No heavy at all 209/- for one box included taxesKeep going good guys..

Are you bored taking North Indian foods from South Indian restaurant? Then you must try the limited yet handcrafted North Indian cuisines in Norfest which is rapidly increasing its presence in the city. I strongly recommend to all the city dwellers to stop by through this unique chain at affordable price with premium quality service. Must try- Makki Di Roti and Sarson da saag.

Well this is the first time I ordered from NorFest - The Dhaba. I ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice, dal makhani, 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of Rs. 400. However, very disappointed with the quantity of food. At that price range they are not providing a proper portion . Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging . I gave three star only for the quality .	3.0	2/24/2019 22:35	d√©conseill√©	Le Caf√© de Paris	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-10-25	Fondue savoyarde;Pot-au-feu	42.21	11	14	Kylian Michel

A really good meal at a reasonable price. The quantity was perfect. Not a lot and not too less. I ordered the paneer combo and shikanji . Norfest dhaba has probably one of the best packaging materials. Looking at the box itself I started feeling more hungry. The only part in the meal that disappointed me was the shikanji.

Another thing we had was amritsari kulcha with chole - kulcha was good but chole can be made better. overall a must go to place for the northside taste.	4.0	2/2/2019 14:23	recommand√©	Le Dragon Rouge	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-04-13	Kimchi;Pho;Laksa	76.23	18	20	Agathe Marques

The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city. The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. So overall not recommended.VFM: 4/5Taste: 3/5	3.0	1/4/2019 10:58	d√©conseill√©	Le Ch√¢teau de Cuisine	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-06-21	Tartare de boeuf	18.46	15	16	Sarah Silva

We took buffet and got only 3 Non veg starters - Fish Prawns and Chicken - each 1 type. Food is average, as usual, nothing special. Rs 783/- (699 + 5% GST + 7% service charge) for this buffet is very too high. Not worth.

Absolutely horrendous service!! We avail Zomato gold services, and we had clearly mentioned that we wanted to avail this service before entering the restaurant. We placed our order at 3 p.m and they ask us to show the Zomato Gold ID right after 3 p.m (restaurant closes at 3 p.m and kitchen at 3:15), each restaurant seems to have a different policy and we customers should know beforehand what the policy is? We had made it crystal clear that we were Zomato Gold holders and they said we could show the ID later. How is it fair that the staff asks us for the ID after the restaurant has closed and when we could not unlock it!! We are first time users of Zomato Gold.We had to walk out. Horrible service. Stay away from this place if you do not want to be treated poorly by the manager and the staff. Thank you for ruining a special day!!! Why do such places have Zomato Gold partnership? Probably what they're good at, is cheating customers.	1	9/13/2018 15:33	√† √©viter d'urgence	Le Caf√© Mexicain	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-06-15	Carne Asada;Polenta	35.32	20	22	Marie Viana

Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.We would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies.	4	8/20/2018 11:05	recommand√©	La Cr√™perie de Bruges	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-01-24	Salade li√©geoise;Salade li√©geoise;Couques de Dinant;Couques de Dinant	75.88	14	17	Gabin Sanchez
Their portion sizes are good for 2-3 people for most of their dishes unlike what your server would suggest. Probably he has seen a different sample size :) But this is a nice Chinese place serving both buffet and a la carte. Do try their Ginger Fried Rice and Chilli Garlic Noodles. Again, I stand guilty for viewing and commenting on the menu from a vegetarian standpoint but do try their spring rolls too :)	4	8/17/2018 14:10	recommand√©	La Brasserie Flamande	Hospitality and service: 5	2018-12-22	Pot-au-feu;Filet am√©ricain;Filet am√©ricain	46.11	14	16	√âlise S√°nchez
Completely disappointed. The staff was clearly reluctant to work.The food was mediocre at best. We ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. Only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. Nothing was made fresh.We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.Thoroughly disappointing.Ambience is the only saving grace for this place.Food *Ambience ****Staff courtesy **	2	8/15/2018 16:10	d√©conseill√©	Caf√© Parisien	Hospitality and service: 0	2018-08-28	Galette compl√®te;Bouef √† la mode;Fondue savoyarde	62.46	9	11	Margaux Alonso
A must visit place for their exquisite Asian cuisine ,not just for the dishes they offer but also for the authentic taste of those dishes !The ambience is so appropriate to aggrevate your hunger and salivate your mouth. One does start feeling the aura of fine dine - for which the crockery and cutlery is the first noticable example.We ordered vegetable chilli sticks ,salt and pepper chicken as starters .Vegetable chilli sticks (1st pic) is a must for all vegetarians here ,if felt really satiating having tasted one of the best Chinese dish I ever ordered (5/5)Salt and pepper chicken was good - as told by my accompanying friend . I found the texture good ! He rates it (4/5)For Main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish .Chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies .very balanced ! A must to mention is the quantity served , it can be shared by 3 people (4.5/5)Button mushroom ,diced babycorn in oysters sause- this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy . It blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles .(4/5)I also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged 160 bucks for that (2/5)Final verdict - authentic asian food with great ambeicne .with Zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently !	4	8/13/2018 1:47	recommand√©	Le Caf√© des Artistes	Hospitality and service: 2	2018-12-06	Waterzooi de poulet;Waterzooi de poulet;Poulet basquaise;Waterzooi de poulet	87.09	9	11	Sacha 
I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.Main Course -1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.Dessert1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again.	3	8/12/2018 9:48	d√©conseill√©	La Cr√™perie Bretonne	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-04-18	Pain bagnat;Souffl√© au fromage	33.93	17	19	√âva V√°squez
We went to urban Asia for lunch around 1 30 on a Sunday for ala carte and I certainly would not recommend it for anyone. Though the food was good, the service was pathetic.

#urbanasia #panasian #delightfulexperience.Well this place is quite an old one in jubilee hills standing strong for quite a long time now. The food here is an absolute delight. When they say PAN ASIAN , they mean PAN ASIAN . The experience of the jubilee hills branch was so amazing that I was being pulled to try their gachibowli branch. And I would love to visit this place over and again, if not for anything but the ORANGE CHICKEN.Food( 4/5)The food here is an absolute delight. No chance is left for any complaint. Good to mention, both the time I have tried ala carte and not the buffet.Starting with the spare ribs to the chilli basil Chiken to the sanghai prawns, all of them were absolutely delicious. The spare ribs is a must try as the same taste quite different from the normal spare ribs, it has a Chinese tinge instead of a continental touch which is taste changer.The aroma of the chilli basil chicken is enough to fill the heart with good vibes. Fresh, refreshing yet light on stomach this item is a perfect starter.The sanghai praws are good, well cooked and a bit tangy to change the taste bud.Amongst all their dishes , my all time favorite which pull me to this place over and again is the ORANGE CHICKEN , which is a must must try here. This dish is an absolute delight to the minf, soul and taste bud. This I believe is the most innovative pan Asian dish which I haven't had in a long time. I call this an innovative dish because no other pan Asian restaurant is able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything.Service (4/5)I believe a restaurant can be surely judged by it's staff.. Here the staff knows all their dishes so well that they are promptly able to suggest you with the right dishes to compliment each other. Kudos to the staff.Ambiance ( 4/5)As urban Asia is a chain of restaurant, we were made to sit at their Indian counterpart as it was a Saturday night and quite late . The interior is quite interesting and has a touch of the rural India in it's decor which I guess is a perfect combination for the Indian restaurant.happilyfoodies.wordpress.com	4	8/6/2018 19:58	recommand√©	La Table d'Amis	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-04-26	Tartare de boeuf	10.33	18	19	Pauline P√©rez

This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that's about it.Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all. The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.It's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment. Could give it a try for the ambiance though.	3	5/11/2019 21:28	d√©conseill√©	Le Petit Gourmet	Hospitality and service: 4	2020-03-16	Canard √† l'orange;Steak frites	29.67	10	13	Julia Ara√∫jo
Have been to lunch with friends here today, first things, ambiance seems to be pretty good, i think people just carried on ambiance for this location. Serving is damn slow, even though not much of crowd in the restaurant. Price is pretty on a higher side, virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink. We need to ask several times to serve, also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters, when asked, the same was brought later, Welcome Drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad. Desserts were not so great and not many. Felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark. All in All pathetic service, you will literally ask 'n' number of times for food which is served on table. Not a wide range of dishes. Taste not so great especially with mock tails.

Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke? We had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban Asia and Eat India company are together. The staff didn't attend us for a long time. I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with.	3	5/4/2019 14:01	d√©conseill√©	La Belle √âtoile	Delivery: 1	2020-02-25	Gratin Dauphinois	19.42	14	15	Manon Chevalier
Instagram | veganyums_Drop in to this place with my partner for lunch,.They have zomato gold 1+1 food offer.. Ambiance is pretty authentic more like village and antique piece were drawing my attention....liked the quotes on pillars..In starter, we ordered Kaju aur bhutte ki seekh which was too soft that break in small pieces.. Actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly.. Taste wise it was little bland so, there was only cashew taste I could feel..In main course, we ordered Patiala Shahid paneerWhich was one of their signature dish which I was expecting to be good in taste..but again I disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamy..Ajwain paratha and naan was good in tasteMy experience was not so good..plus, staff members were not aware of anything regarding dish..	2	5/1/2019 15:45	d√©conseill√©	Caf√© Parisien	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-06-06	Pain bagnat;Galette compl√®te;Bouef √† la mode;Salade Lyonnaise	93.22	11	14	Antoine Vidal
Instagram | veganyums_Eat India company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. Interestingly, in eat India company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.When we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.Finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.In main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.After having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place. And in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill.	2	4/27/2019 14:00	d√©conseill√©	La Maison de la Bi√®re	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-03-17	Fajitas;Salade li√©geoise;Fajitas;Moules-frites	96.59	15	17	Ana√´lle Duval

Happened to visit this place for dinner on last Sunday. The ambience is amazing with decor pieces from Rajasthan. They have used various elements in a smart way. We opted for a dinner buffet. The variety of items in the buffet were good. But starters were served cold on the table. This place is decently priced.

#DisappointedWent for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great.	3	2/10/2019 11:46	recommand√©	Chez Andr√©	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-01-13	Boulets √† la li√©geoise;Lapin √† la Kriek;Potjesvlees	50.24	9	11	Louna Durand
Eat India Company (EIC). So this is a very interesting place. You go there, and first impressions very good. When you are seated, you get 3 menu cards, 4 actually. Besides EIC, you are also given the menu of Urban Asia and Tiki Shack. It's all in one place. Now dont be surprised if you go there to have in Urban Asia and are given all three menu cards. HAHA!Ok. So there was buffet at the EIC. I scanned thru it and they had very good options. There were number of options. Very intriguing. Though i had √Ä la cart. Ambience is very good. You want to go and see whats on every wall, it's interesting. Lighting is good, you get to see what you are eating (i've seen some dont have enough lighting. Not talking about Dialogue in the dark here, hehe). Taste was good, as in ok. I've tasted better biryanis at other places. All and all it was a good experience. Nothing like WOW or Very different. It's a good place, your regular go out and have good food.	4	2/1/2019 5:58	recommand√©	La Brasserie Fran√ßaise	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-12-28	Galette compl√®te;Navarin d'agneau;Steak frites	48.93	15	16	Nina S√°nchez
The place gets its name probably from EAST INDIA COMPANY and they have maintained a quite good vintage ambience in there.Though the prices are in a bit higher end, but thats something you can expect from a brand like URBAN ASIA.Now talking about the food, the varieties offered in both veg and nonveg is quite good and delicious. They take there their time to get the food, but thats because they cook it hot right after the order is placed.Overall a good place for family as well as to hangout with friends.	5	1/18/2019 9:28	recommand√©	Le Petit Caf√©	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-12-24	Poulet basquaise;Tartare de boeuf	38.15	20	21	Ma√´l Diaz

I have been to Eat India Company twice. To Sum up my experience, I found the service Sloppy and mindless. Food has fluctuating standards here, for a meal that cost almost 2k for 2 people without drinks one would expect at least some good to come out of the most basic cuisines. The kadhai paneer which should have been lip smacking and flavourful was totally bland.The service was so lethargic that I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 3-4 tables were booked.The only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great, authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer.P.S. I was pretty excited about going to this place but unfortunately my experience was so bad that I shall never visit this one again.	2	12/21/2018 5:41	d√©conseill√©	La Maison de la Bi√®re	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-08-25	Salade li√©geoise	20.85	15	18	Maxime Vincent

It has absolutely nothing for vegetarians. There are a couple of starters, but that is pretty much it. Absolutely no variety either for the main course and even the deserts were disappointing.

The receptionist was very impolite. She started shouting at us when we asked her to call her manager. The most amazing part was when we were told that manager was very busy and cannot come to us.

Well, it seems that they are juggling all the 3 restaurants the owner own. We were given 3 different menu cards, one for appetisers, one for main course and one for Asian cuisine. The service was too slow. We asked for paneer Kadhai instead they served us with Sauf filled Kadhai of paneer which tasted pathetic. The Zomato gold benefits were denied as the Asian cuisine menu was from the other restaurant of the same owner which was not told to us before we ordered. I missed my outstation bus because of this silly confusion of the management.

Descent place. Nice and different Ambience. Buffet was ok ok. It started on a high note with Chicken Shorba followed by starters and main course. And as we were moving to main course taste of food was not great. It was either too much salt or garlic ginger paste.All starters were really nice. Mutton Rogan Josh was best. Thai Green Curry with Steam Rice was delicious. Desert we're hardly available and no one even bothered to refill. Service was nice. Over all ok ok.

Been there after seeing the rating. It is an absolute No resturant. The starters came after 30 min n we always need to remind and followup for serving and its not worth for wait as its tasteless. The drink served is like a coughsyrup with a medicinal smell. There is absolutely nothing to dine even at chinese side. Dessert section is something you will not feel to have it. You will immediately goto icecream counter where you will wait for 20-30 min and finally that fellow will state we dont have that flavour and can only give butterscotch. Its not that it got over by the time ur turn came, it was never there and they made u wait n finally forcing u to have wht he prepared than wht u want. Finally you will end up paying such huge bucks for drinking water and go straight to office to do lunch at your own office canteen which will look so beautiful than ever before. If u dont want to have food but soend money then its a worth resturant to visit.	1	10/14/2018 12:35	√† √©viter d'urgence	Le Bistrot Asiatique	Delivery: 3	2018-12-04	Dim Sum;Kung Pao Chicken;Kung Pao Chicken	59	12	14	L√©on Ramirez

The hot and tantalising dal bukhara when rolled over a garlic naan with tinge of butter spread is an orgasmic treat to the tongue!!While the other items were good, bukhara was the show stopper !!! Missing bukhara in EIC is a big miss! You may rather order just Bukhara dal and your palette has had its share of joy and would not ask for more !!!	5	10/6/2018 14:14	recommand√©	Le Temple de la Sushi	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-05-25	Tempura;Laksa	48.35	11	14	M√©lanie Truong

Been here for Sunday dinner buffet. I liked the ambiance with lite music.very peaceful place. Good for families who like to spend with their loved ones. and about food I liked cube corn in veg and fish, chicken & prawns in NV. I loved the mutton curry, it was so tender and delicious. And other items were ok. One thing they need to improve is service, though we opted for buffet they were serving starters at table that too with damn slow service and with repeated reminders.Ambiance 4/5Food 4/5Service 2.5/5One word review: Can try once.	4	10/2/2018 13:38	recommand√©	Le Bistrot Asiatique	Delivery: 0	2019-04-09	Nasi Goreng;Gyoza	45.41	11	13	Rose Silva

We went there yesterday for a late lunch. Google showed their closing time and we were going to reach at 3.15, so we called to confirm and they were ok. We ordered a la carte. Though the food was good, it arrived in pieces. For eg the noodles came first and the gravy came only only half the noodles were finished. The server too looked bit tired indicating it was end of his shift. The Virgin Mojito lacked the freshness and felt like fresh lime. 4.5 star for food, 3 star for service.	4	10/1/2018 9:06	recommand√©	La Friterie Belge	Hospitality and service: 1	2018-11-10	Boulets √† la li√©geoise	11.93	17	19	Noah Ferreira

Been here for lunch and opted for ala carte..Must trys - corn cubesTurn offs - extremely slow service, dessertsFOOD - 3.5/5 - tried corn cubes, crispy potato with butter chilli garlic sauce, paneer lababdar, mint and lemon Ice cream.Corn cubes 5/5 - one of their unqiue dishes. Simply loved it. A highly recommended starters you need to try here.Crispy Potato 4/5 - tasty and light!Paneer lababdar 3.5/5 - taste was quite different and paneer was fresh. The tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it.Tandoor roti 3/5 - was hard.Lemongrass and mint ice cream 2.5/5- I expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors, but I was served with these two separately. Mint ice cream was too strong and we didn't like it, lemongrass was avg.AMBIENCE 4/5 - decent ambience for a family dining..SERVICE 2/5 - extremely slow. Had to remind 2-3 times to get our order.

Being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat!But the restaurant has disappointed.1. Ambience and service was great.2. We went for buffet , firstly the starters weren't that good at taste. Common panner kebab type of starter, corn , chicken, veg kebab. Well none o them weren't good as having them twice.3. Main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. No panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. Skipped and went to the desert section.4. Desserts was like stabbing a dead man. Nothing exciting, only the ice cream was good.Overall, it is expensive and less satisfying. If you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one.	3	9/16/2018 21:43	d√©conseill√©	Le Caf√© des Artistes	Hospitality and service: 1	2018-10-08	Poulet basquaise;Penne all'Arrabbiata	53.2	8	11	L√©o V√°squez
This place served the worst Indian food I could ever ask for in Hyderabad. The towels were dirty and not properly washed. The food was just horrible. Loud music from the pub above will spoil your dining experience even more and when I asked for outdoor seating they lied saying it's only a smokin' area. Not visiting this place ever again. An extra star only coz of the interior otherwise this place is just worthy of a 1 star.	2	9/15/2018 8:34	recommand√©	Chez Lucien	Delivery: 3	2019-07-11	Canard √† l'orange;Blanquette de lotte	20.24	9	10	Esteban daSilva

Pathetic!!! A group of 20 people from work visited this place, we didn't have great expectations, at the same time we didn't foresee a terrible experience that it eventually would turn out to be. Half of us were seated close to the glass facing the Gachibowli road, thanks to their incredible maintenance, the ac was so poor, we were all sweating profusely. We weren't served starters for atleast 40 minutes. The choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least. The food (starters, main course, desserts) tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream. We will never be going back to this place.	1	9/13/2018 1:16	recommand√©	Chez Pierre	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-09-09	Souffl√© au fromage;Souffl√© au fromage;Salade Lyonnaise	58.18	19	21	Ma√´l Legrand

A group of 4, we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening. The location is quite on the main road, however, the parking and the entry is terrible. They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn-off.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAfter entering the restaurant, we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor. It had a very India taste to it. They had old locks, keys, doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look. üòçComing to the food, there is a plethora of options on their menu. Instead of going through it all, we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer. Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination. Corn cubes cannot be missed here. My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though. Moving to main course, we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries. Paneer Lababdar, Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices. Food was decent.The service was not impeccable. It ca surely be improved. Also, they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal. Quite a surprise. üòëThe price point is a little on the higher side- probably much more than average. üòÖüòÖ It can be a great negative. They accepted gold on food, so yay!Overall, a good experience, but probably not one worth visiting again.	3	9/9/2018 22:56	d√©conseill√©	Brasserie de la Gare	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-01-28	Bouef √† la mode;Laksa;Tartare de boeuf;Laksa	60.43	17	18	Ambre Dubois

The antique royal doors, old locks and vintage pictures hanging on the wall and ceiling added to the charm. Quality and quantity is almost worth the price.

If you‚Äôre wondering what to do on Sunday then head to Eat India Company, Gachibowli. Eat India Company has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hyderabad since years. Now they‚Äôve opened a new branch in Gachibowli. Yay to all my office folks. Everything from the ambience to the d√©cor, to the music is wonderful. The quality and taste of the food over the years has been consistent. I love love love Indian food and they have some delicious dishes if you‚Äôre a meat lover. Everything from shorba to kebabs to nalli ki nihari to dum biryani is sooooooo yum!On Sundays, the branch at Gachibowli teams up with Urban Asia to host a special brunch from 12 pm to 3 pm. Urban Asia is another brilliant kitchen for Asian food. If you love Chinese and Indian food, you cannot miss this brunch. They have more than 27 dishes with veg and non-veg options plus desserts. Apart from this, they also had chaat and sushi as well when I went. All this at 888 per person only. What a steal deal. My favorite five dishes from the menu are hara bara kebab, chicken angara, kang pao fish, mutton rogan josh and of course the Dal Bukhara [for those of you who don‚Äôt know, this is a velvety makhani style dal that is not spicy but packed with flavor].Make sure to book your table in advance. Another good tip in case you‚Äôre someone who wakes up late or you forget to book a table is to go after 2pm cause it‚Äôs usually not crowded at that time. Let me know how you like it! Thank me later.	5	9/6/2018 12:07	recommand√©	Le Moulin √† Frites	Hospitality and service: 5	2018-09-30	Pain √† la grecque;Moules-frites;Moules-frites	43.87	7	10	Th√©o Diaz

It was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we didn‚Äôt expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure.So it‚Äôs a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light. Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends.I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time.So in the spread, something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns. I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. It was amazing.The chicken was alright. But I can say but prawns were the best. Although they were really small, but can‚Äôt complain much. They didn‚Äôt give us fish even after we asked for it.Staff: attentive and service was okay.Ambience: very nice place, looks good, clean, effort was put in to make it look nice.Food: food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. They were pretty bad.Complaints: Starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. Didn‚Äôt wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.Second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. Lost our appetite soon after that.Third is with one of the waiters, probably didn‚Äôt want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. He agreed to get some but never showed up with it. I hope it‚Äôs his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it.If those factors are avoided, then will go again definitely.	3	8/24/2018 22:25	d√©conseill√©	Le Petit Belge	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-07-05	Boulets √† la li√©geoise	5.27	13	16	Rose Girard

A true match for Theo‚Äôs from Mumbai, one of Hyderabad‚Äôs finest bakery üò¨The Triple Chocolate Cake is just designed and made to perfection! The cake is soft and gooey, full of chocolate and provided in amazing packaging.üòáI‚Äôve been a regular with their brownies, they‚Äôre super light and yet so tasty!

When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it.My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard. Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special.We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. So, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store. I made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed! To add to it no one answered the phone.I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is.My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners.I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)Update: I have a facebook post which certifies that minimum 5 friends of mine have dealt with similar bad experiences.	1	9/25/2018 22:40	recommand√©	Chez Lucien	Delivery: 5	2018-12-23	Choucroute garnie;Bouef √† la mode;Choucroute garnie;Blanquette de lotte	82.73	9	10	Rapha√´l Smith

"I have never denied I have sweet teeth. You read that right, not tooth - teeth. I take every opportunity to indulge in sweets because it makes me happy.

I make it a point to take back their cupcake boxes home whenever I am visiting my parents.This place is pretty expensive and there‚Äôs no denying that but if you can afford these indulgences maybe once a year, it‚Äôs so worth it.I have usually ordered their eggless cupcakes in a mixed box of vanilla and chocolate but I have tried their sample cakes multiple times and I can‚Äôt wait to order them.Note: they usually need advance orders so give your order on time and they are closed on Sundays so make sure that you call and confirm before making the trip.	5	8/14/2018 1:19	recommand√©	La Fiesta Grande	Delivery: 3	2019-04-09	Carne Asada	25.85	18	19	Louna Cunha

Fine baking it is! Place looks classy. It is expensive for a takeaway. Staff at the counter was not very warm. Cupcakes are good especially the chocolate ones.

Although, I have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place, I can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about. Hochn√§sig is a word that came to my mind when I visited this place the first few times. Hoch is high and n√§sig comes from nose. This German word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as ‚Äúhochn√§sig‚Äù does. However, that is not all they are. They are in fact one of the best bakeries in Hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. I said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:1.    This place is expensive.2.    Except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.3.    They don‚Äôt sell cake-slices. You must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.Now coming to the gooooooood stuff‚Ä¶Brownies:The best I have ever had! The chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. I know some of you may say that that‚Äôs not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. BUT, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.Chocolate Cakes:I have tried one of their Classic Chocolate cake and Triple Chocolate cake. All the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. The best one is clearly the Triple Chocolate cake.Carrot Cake:To me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. One is the desi kind that you get at Parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. The other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. Labonel being a ‚Äúfine baking‚Äù place naturally has the latter kind. Although I am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, Labonel‚Äôs carrot cake is the best I have ever had in this category.Cheesecakes:I have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry I think. It was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. The base was delicious too. However, the cheesecakes at Eclat or Chili‚Äôs are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.Cupcakes:Cupcakes are their only product that I am not a fan of. They are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. You can give the cupcakes a complete miss.Cookies:Choco-chip, Double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. Soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm‚Ä¶Miscellaneous:There are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. The honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.Overall, if you don‚Äôt mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don‚Äôt give this place a miss.	4.5	11/3/2017 17:12	recommand√©	Le Caf√© du Commerce	Delivery: 3	2017-12-17	Galette compl√®te;Pain bagnat	34.73	9	10	Camille Espinosa
"#BrownieLove  # BakedWithLoveClassic calm interior. I loved their theme color ""Blue"". Packaging is sober and royal, an excellent house warming present. Brownies were soft, chocolaty and yum yum yum. They were simply the best. One has to buy a complete box of 15 piece medium sized square brownie. Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie. Suggestion: I don't want to go and eat chocoLava in Dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have Brownie here.

This place is fine baking indeed. Classy outlet as well, with very foreign inspired interiors.Their chocolate chip cookie is very good (chewy and tasty).The honey chocolate cake is a good bet for your evening snack.The cupcakes here are my all time favorite (choclate feels better than the red velvet)Their brownie is also one of the best in Hyderabad and is quite a good option for gifting people as well as being a recepient of such a box of delight.	4.5	7/29/2017 23:59	recommand√©	La Cocina Mexicana	Delivery: 0	2017-09-01	Enchiladas	5.43	17	20	Mathis S√°
I have ordered carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. Their online menu says it's their signature cake. It was the worst cake I ate till date. It's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. And of course cream cheese frosting. There were simply too many kismiss in there. I hated every bit of that cake.I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. How much ever I say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake.	3.5	7/17/2017 0:31	recommand√©	Le Bistrot de la Mer	Hospitality and service: 1	2017-12-10	Bouef √† la mode;Bouef √† la mode;P√¢t√© en cro√ªte;P√¢t√© en cro√ªte	102.27	9	11	Rose Martins
Had their classic brownie cake which is served on a box. The brownies are fine, but too expensive for their taste I would say.

I am in love with cup cakes and Labonel made it much more romantic üòÑThe cream and the bread are just perfect and the flavours are amazing. Though I felt it a bit over priced, it didn't come to my mind as long as I was indulged in eating them. It would be great experience worth the price, you must try them.Next target: their brownies üòÉThe only thing I would like to be changed about this place is that, they should have menu options for the customers to eat there itself. It is such a beautifully designed place and just takeaway makes the experience unfinished.	5	5/31/2017 22:22	recommand√©	Le Jardin des D√©lices	Hospitality and service: 4	2017-11-20	Spring Rolls;Tom Yum	48.65	20	21	Sarah Silva

There's no better place to satisfy your dessert cravings than this heavenly place, the Labonel. I love their cake measuring schemes, unlike kilos :-) one must have to forget about calories strictly when you visit this place.My favs are brownies, red velvet, dark chocolate, white chocolte and all cup cake versions! They're so soft, melts in mouth, just so yummm in tummy:-)Yes! They are very expensive. Almost costs a bomb !! 5500 Rs for a birthday cake but its all worth it once a while for any of your grand special occasion..

Very poor store management. Ordered for an eggless cake on Friday 05th May 2017 and they confirmed my order. Before the pickup I just called them to check if the cake is ready and they simply say there is no order on my name at all. This is pure irresponsibility on the part of Labonel Gachibowli.

I absolutely love the Red velvet cupcakes from labonel. They are the best! Although I am from Bombay, I would rate these cupcakes to be the best in the world(And trust me I try Red velvet Cupcakes & Cookies everywhere I travel!). They beat Theobroma in Bombay Hollow.

One of the premium bakers in gachibowli, most of the items are made to order, probably 24hrs prior booking is required, found only few cupcakes, brownies ready, and that too it's for takeaway, can't dine in... Bought the chocolate and red velvet brownies, cost for 1kg around 800 or so... Good packing. Taste is good. But there are places which serves better brownies.Cost is at the higher end.	3.5	2/27/2017 0:42	recommand√©	Caf√© Rio	Hospitality and service: 1	2017-03-31	Guacamole;Chiles en Nogada;Chilaquiles	38.13	19	21	Charlotte Truong
Delicious chocolate brownies... The packaging is awesome too!!Been wanting to visit ever since I heard about the Banjara Hills branch, but somehow never got the chance to.The price is a bit steep though, but an occasional indulgence which the product is meant for anyway, is perfectly fine. I'm not too good with dessert consistency and stuff, but all i can say is this is a place I would definitely recommend for dessert treats and parties.The brownies are moderately sweet and rich and not too moist.I will be back for the cupcakes.	4.5	2/23/2017 15:15	recommand√©	Le Ch√¢teau de Cuisine	Hospitality and service: 3	2017-09-25	Pain bagnat;P√¢t√© en cro√ªte;Canard √† l'orange	66.34	15	17	L√©na Lopes
I have been lusting after this place, after reading too many 5 star reviews on Zomato.  So yesterday the occasion was right  and I was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my SO. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. The staff at Labonel don't know anything about customer service.They were very rude and mean to us. I wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if I was there to steal their products. Very impatient and unwilling to help. And also their phone number never works. Tried calling several times and never got a response. Anyways coming to food. I only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes The price burnt a hole in my  pocket. Only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. The flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. I tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and I  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. Vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. Yes it was like eating a sponge(I am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). Nothing but just hype . I have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries.  Final note: Never ever  going to visit the place again.

Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. Amazing cakes and brownies. It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever.My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes.	3.5	2/12/2017 21:49	recommand√©	Le Temple de la Sushi	Hospitality and service: 3	2017-11-17	Tempura;Tempura;Pad Thai;Miso Soup	101.1	11	12	Chlo√© daSilva

Absolutely delighted with our overall experience. The shop had an excellent festive decoration. Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!! Will definitely recommend.	5	1/13/2017 19:03	recommand√©	Le Bistrot de Bruxelles	Hospitality and service: 4	2017-09-29	Filet am√©ricain;Boulettes √† la sauce tomate;Boulettes √† la sauce tomate;Boulets √† la li√©geoise	32.57	9	12	Robin Mendes

The cupcakes were really good. Soft and creamy. Their cookies also felt very different and almost melted in the mouth. The only drawback is the quantity which you need to buy for an order as it's purely a takeaway restaurant.

I dont know much about gachibowli branch, but banjara hills branch has the worst costumer service that I have ever seen in my life..! Very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place. They have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve. My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..! If you have a big party, please don't rely and order anything from this place.

Updated review:Ever since my first visit to Labonel I have already been a sucker for their brownies and now am gonna be for their cup cakes too. This cup cake box has 3 varieties of mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. All the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft, airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top. They are definitely at the top of their game right now.P.S. the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste.Previous review:A class apart, fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle. Labonel holds a very different, sophisticated yet very pleasant aura. All this while I avoided this sweet gem coz I assumed it's hell expensive (considering cost for two stated as 3000) but that's certainly not the case.Because I was in a hurry and dint have time to try, test and enquire about all the items, I quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies. Heavenly, decadent, sinful, melt in the mouth, luxurious, delectable, delightful....I can go on and on raving about this piece of art. I do like to clear the air about misconception of Labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not. A box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal, coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering ;PWith Suvi Kanchan	4.5	12/1/2016 0:39	recommand√©	La Brasserie Fran√ßaise	Hospitality and service: 4	2017-07-02	Lapin √† la Kriek;Steak frites	28.85	15	16	√âva Huang

The classic chocolate brownies of Labonel are like heaven! They are extremely soft and melt in your mouth. The cookies are yummy too. The interiors are very well done up and pleasing to the eye with the classic vintage decor. The only sad part is that they don't sell the brownies per piece and you need to buy an entire box.	4.5	11/12/2016 20:15	recommand√©	Le Palais Imp√©rial	Delivery: 1	2016-11-19	Tempura;Spring Rolls	35.14	20	23	Pauline Oliveira

I went to Labonel a long time ago.There has always been a lot of hype about Labonel, especially for their cupcakes. I personally disliked the red velvet cupcakes because of the buttercream frosting. Second, the cupcakes were available only in boxes and not individually which wasn't cost effective or practical at all.However, I tried their brownies at a later point through a friend's purchase. They are quite delicious. I would definitely have more. But wouldn't go through the effort of buying a whole box.	3.5	10/13/2016 1:04	recommand√©	Le Petit Caf√©	Hospitality and service: 2	2017-02-19	Poulet basquaise	23.5	20	23	Thibault Thomas

I am not a big fan of sports bikes, but I totally loved the place.The interior and lightening is really soothing.I preferred sitting on the first floor as it gave a better view of the place.For food, we ordered a chilli garlic toast, chocolate donut with Mocha Frappe and Vanilla Frappe.Individual Rating:Food: (4/5) the donut was not upto the markService : (5/5) It's self service, but my order was ready in like 5 minutesPocket Friendly : (4/5) The portion size was really small for the money they were chargingAmbiance : (4/5)I really wanted to give this place a 4.5 star, but that cannot happen on Zomato now.	4	3/18/2019 15:39	recommand√©	Le Caf√© des Artistes	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-10-25	Poulet basquaise	20.28	7	9	L√©on Kim

I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.But the negative point is that they don‚Äôt have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items.	3	2/14/2019 21:13	d√©conseill√©	Le Bistrot de Li√®ge	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-04-01	Boulets √† la li√©geoise;Gaufres de Li√®ge;Boulets √† la li√©geoise;Moules-frites	65.47	11	14	Marie Diaz

The first thing that strikes you about the place is the ambience. You have a triumph thunderbird LT on one side with it's massive round headlights and a ducati monster on the other side in a dashing red. There's great music playing and there's riding gear, etc. hanging off the walls with numbers to call in case you want to rent some of it. I went in early morning around 8:30. The cleaning lady was still sweeping and it was kinda hot inside (ac switched off probably). There was no one behind the counter. Asked the cleaning lady and she shouted out for someone who came right away and took my order. Ordered for a mint mocha and a cinnamon roll. The guy was coughing randomly (hopefully not into my food or drink), but I found this to be an annoyance. I mean, you can have the fanciest of ambience but if the people who serve there aren't trained in basic hygiene and cleanliness, it all goes to waste. The mint mocha was superb and the cinnamon roll was ok-ish. As I paid, I got a torn note, so I gave it back (to exchange it of course). Instead the guy just took it and went away. I waited for a while, then called out. Asked for my money and instead of one note, he handed over two. The dude was clearly in his sleep - probably having been through the night shift.Giving the rating only for ambience and quality of food. 1 point taken away for the serving attendant. Oh, and they don't have anything non-veg.	4	11/29/2018 17:59	recommand√©	Le Temple de la Sushi	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-09-17	Tom Yum;Pad Thai;Pad Thai	75.18	12	13	Camille Simon
I was here with my bunch of friends a few days ago. I was in awe with this place and I guess anyone who visits here would also be, by the beautiful big toys this place has. From luxurious cars to super sexy sports bike, anything you want to rent this place has.Coming to the food, they don‚Äôt have much variety, it‚Äôs just pizza, pasta, sandwich and desserts. We had ordered veg pizza- loved it, loaded with cheese and veggies with super thin crust. Four cheese pizza- I didn‚Äôt like it that much, made up of four types of cheese with super thin crust. Veg sandwich- nailed it, it was the most yummiest one for me. Paneer sandwich- my friends loved it, I don‚Äôt eat paneer so I can‚Äôt say that for myself. White sauce pasta- it was good, more veggies to it would have made it perfect for me.Coming to drinks, I ordered cool blue slush and I loved it taste wise , another reason being, it took too long to sipped up fully.Overall, it was a good experience for me.	4	11/24/2018 13:10	d√©conseill√©	Restaurant Sakura	Delivery: 1	2019-05-21	P√¢t√© en cro√ªte;P√¢t√© en cro√ªte;Laksa	62.72	19	20	Esteban Dufour

Love this place from the word go. I always wanted to visit this cafe since it's launch. Everything about this place is super cool - be it the timing, concept, ambiance or the quality of coffees and snacks served. I visited this place on a bright Sunday morning and just fell in love with the place as I got a seat right next to muscular triumph. They have great collection of cars and bikes, which even one can hire on rent. I ordered hazelnut coffee, paneer kulcha and my friend ordered some dry fruits crispy sweet croissant along with coffee. Paneer kulcha was too good and coffee was just fine.

After a lot of reco-s and solid rating everywhere, I finally tried out Driven Cafe - mainly to sample their coffee. Unfortunately, I was disappointing with the Cappuccino. Tried a 'medium' Cappuccino - which is a double expresso shot coffee with foamed milk, and it was very underwhelming. No aroma, no kick, it was very bland and generic. Had a hard time getting through it. The wife tried Frappe, which was as per her taste and my daughter (who has a major sweet tooth) found her choco chip brownie nice. However, I was quite disappointed overall.	3	9/17/2018 10:51	d√©conseill√©	Brasserie de la Gare	Delivery: 0	2019-07-24	Blanquette de lotte;Laksa;Bouef √† la mode;Laksa	66.16	18	21	Emma Freitas
Must visit place for supercars and super bike lovers. These fantastic machines will definitely enthral your looks. Coming to the ambience the environment of the place looks like you're literally sitting in a garage, between few superbikes. The blackcurrant milkshake tasted really great but the pizza didn't taste that good. If it was made a little spicy it would be great, but the chilly flakes saved it from being a total disappointment.Can definitely give this place a try.	4	9/13/2018 22:46	recommand√©	Osteria Italia	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-04-19	Caprese (Insalata Caprese)	20.07	16	17	Lison Li

The chilli cheese toast is a disappointment.Sizzling brownie was yum and so was pesto pasta though it was slightly overpriced.One of the cool places to enjoy and try different coffee drinks, I must say. üòáü§òüèΩ	4	8/31/2018 21:11	recommand√©	Le Panda Gourmand	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-03-18	Hainanese Chicken Rice	16.5	15	18	L√©na Harris
This place excites me everytime I go, My most fav midnight hangout place with friends. I've been a fan of this cafe not just because of the bikes, cars and badass ambience but their excellent coffes too. They serve one of the Hyderabad's best espressos along with few other cold coffees and shakes. But, there are less snacks options. My suggestion would be to increase the snacks options and adding some exotic desserts like sizzling brownies.	5	8/28/2018 19:02	recommand√©	Le Bistrot Asiatique	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-04-27	Dim Sum;Satay;Satay;Satay	88.15	13	14	L√©a Francois

Great place to spend time. Nice ambience and music. I am an automobile enthusiast and this place is really nice. Super cars and bikes on rent are parked outside. The fruit cakes and coffee flavours are also nice. Some variety of drinks are not available at timea which is a turn down.

It is my late night stop when I am in need for a coffee. Have been there dozen of times. The most eye catchy thing about the cafe is the super bikes and cars parked outside. The cafe has a rustic ambiance and is decorated with bikes and posters.I usually end up having a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate. I loved them both.So if you are craving for a coffee in the middle of the night then this is the place to go. Not only this, they have amazing cars and bikes for rent.So a must visit place !! üòäüòä	4	8/13/2018 12:02	recommand√©	Le Bistrot de Bruxelles	Hospitality and service: 4	2018-09-17	Pot√©e li√©geoise	6.55	9	12	Victor Garnier

My go to cafe for any discussion or meeting. Have been to this place more than 10 times by now, and never get disappointed.The ambience stands out from all the nearby places, with whole garage theme. If you look closely the tables on first floor are actually made up on car and truck parts as well! Too much innovation and thinking, is just mind blowing. The wall next to stairs full of pictures is most photogenic. The cherry on top is their songs selection.All the coffees taste great, especially the fact you get it even after midnight. Although my personal favourites are Flat white and Cappuccino. The quite bites available as Paneer Kulcha is recommended as well. Don't forget to take good camera along with you while going here.	5	6/29/2018 16:17	recommand√©	La Cucaracha	Delivery: 5	2018-12-27	Tostadas	14.66	12	14	Gaspard Girard
What catches your eyes could be the expensive Cars and Super Bikes (which you could rent), but once you enter inside the place - you have to flex your muscles to push the door which has a heavy chain- you get a good feeling.

If bikes, cars and coffee are your weaknesses then the Driven Cafe is no less than heaven for you. Their luxurious collection of supercars and bikes includes fantabulous FORD-MUSTANG-5, premium PORSCHE-911 CARRERA-4S0, the Hulk of Bikes TRIUMPH-ROCKET-III, speedy SUZUKI-HAYABUSA and the kinetic KAWASAKI-ZX14R- which is also one of the world‚Äôs fastest bike to name a few and guess what one could also rent these amazing creations from their website. At present, their fleet consists of 150 cars, 50 motorcycles and 7 bicycles.If this doesn‚Äôt satisfy the gearhead inside you then there‚Äôs some delicious food and coffee for killing your hunger cravings even in those odd hours of the night!The place is a brilliant amalgamation of a cafe and a bike museum. The ground floor of this establishment is a quaint cafe which sells food and beverages. It is very vintage in feel and decor and you will be treated by a very well spoken staff. The cafe also has a store which sells/rents biking accessories including biking jackets, helmets and other accessories.Coming to the food now, the first thing we had here was the Chili Cheese Toast which is a cheddar melt on white bloomer with an orange mayo. It was quite filling and really tasty. Next up was the flavourful Apple Pie with ice-cream that totally melted in mouth and tasted heavenly with ice-cream.This was complemented with a selfie coffee and a regular coffee. The ‚Äòselfie coffee‚Äô has your selfie printed on the coffee foam purely made of edible ink. This is one-of-a-kind experience. You click a selfie and Whatsapp that on a number, they‚Äôll print that particular selfie on the coffee.Lastly we had the Turkish Baklava Twins which were crunchy, nutty, flaky and really delicious. The place has a lot of variety in terms of coffee which included Colombian Coffee, Death Wish, Illy Monka, Birch Coffee, Araku Tribal Coffee, Organic Decaf Peppermint Mocha and many more.The place is definitely a must go!Review Credit: Karan Bhyanachiclifebyte.com	5	6/10/2018 9:48	recommand√©	Le Panda Gourmand	Hospitality and service: 2	2018-06-19	Curry Laksa;Kung Pao Chicken;Tom Yum	59.46	16	19	Nino Alvarez
Explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long. Has an American cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 AM at least. The cheese garlic bread, veg puffs and Latte coffee were pretty good. It's self service and the order came in pretty quick. One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite.

The products tasted real good.I feel the cheese üßÄ on my mouth when I was having the cheese melt wrap. Chicken was tender and cooked real soft. They are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them. Wrap was cooked equally good.Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap was awesome. It gave a different taste altogether.Highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good. Rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion. It can be had by both - children and elders. They have two differential cooked chicken on the top. Both are boneless and cooked with perfection.

Ordered the paneer wraps, one with the cheese, and other with a tangy masala. N a paneer rice bowl too. Paneer treat to myself. The wraps were perfectly made, with the covering prepared well, and the stuffing was mixed well with the right amount of sauces and cheese, giving a juiciness to the wrap. The rice bowl was equally yummy. With rice being cooked well, fragrant with exotic herbs and spices giving a deep ochre n shades of olive green look to the dish. Overall a nice place to order from n worth the money.

Was super excited to try out the special Navratri Thali from Faasos. It had Kuttu Aata parathas, Paneer curry, Sabudana vada, and Sabudana Kheer. Honestly, my excitement dropped down after tasting the parathas, as they were too greasy. Paneer curry, on the other hand, was the savior, Vadas were fine and Kheer was up to the mark. What I liked about the thali was that it had more than enough food for 1 person. I am going with 2 stars as the parathas are the base of this thali and I couldn't finish even half of it. I have very high expectations from Fassos and am sure they will take this feedback well and improve on the quality of parathas.	2	11/15/2018 18:25	d√©conseill√©	Le Chat Noir	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-11-06	Pain √† la grecque;Chicons au gratin;Carbonnade flamande	68.58	11	12	Quentin Diaz

The spices in the parathas were less but that's according to my preference.The paneer makhanwala was creamy and tasty.

I just love the wraps of Faasos and can have them at any time .I mainly like their three wraps - Cheesy corn salsa wrap,Mac n Cheese wrap and Veg pizza wrap. All of them are amazing but Pizza wrap is just mind blowing.They have multiple options for the bread of the wrap as well - multigrain, crispy bake,lacha Parantha etc.Pizza wrap has cheese, vegetables and other sauces in it. It gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazing.The size is big and is good enough as a meal for one personI have also tried chola kulcha and Veg thali from Faasos but in Bangalore,they were also very good.I have tried almost all of their major wraps :Pizza Wrap (5/5)Mac n Cheese wrap (4.5/5)Cheesy corn Salsa(4/5)Aloo wrap (3.5/5)Jumbo Veg wrap(3/5)Egg wrap (3.5/5)Paneer Tikka Wrap (3.5/5)Rajma Chole is also very good.Desserts:I recently tried their Red Velvet cheese cake and it was also mind blowing and definitely worth a try!!It was one of the best red velvet cheese cake,I have ever hadRed velvet (5/5)Raspberry Cheesecake shot(4.5/5)Chocolate Fantasy (4/5)Must try their wraps and especially Pizza wrap!!!	5	11/4/2018 11:43	recommand√©	La Cr√™perie Bretonne	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-08-12	Souffl√© au fromage;Brandade de morue;Bouef √† la mode;Fondue savoyarde	72.25	16	17	Esteban Duarte

"Zomato has asked me to be polite.. ok.. Faasos is delightfully bad in its food quality... When you order a pizza roll.. they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills... They roast it till the end.. just like how your mumma used to make it.. and best part comes next.. Faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive... It's too much fun to see that status - ""Food is being prepared"" , ""Your food is in the kitchen"".. and they won't update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say Surprise.. In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes... So fast da.. then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes... I asked delivery person why so much late da.. He said sir we were cooking your roll property that's why it took time.. open it and try it sir.. you would have never seen such roll.. And he was right.. I never saw the roll only charcoal..

Navratri review program~I ordered sabudana meal and it was super awesome to get the special thali delivered in the navratri season with all the ingredients as needed for the fast. The packaging was good and the order was delivered on time. The thali has sabudana khichdi with loads of potato and peanuts ,curd, sabudana kheer, paneer makhni and a pumpkin chatpata chutney kind of curry. Everything tasted good just that the makhni didn't go with the meal. There could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased. The taste was no doubt best. Fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together. It was a little expensive though but it's worth it.üòÄ Unique menus are always welcome.I am unable to attach all the pics though coz i already reviewed the delivery once which somehow got deleted.

Since it was the festive season, and I wanted to try Navratri specials at Faasos. Tried their Singhada ke aloo parantha, Paneer Makhanwala, Sabudhana ki kheer, Green tomato curry and Curd. It was not as expected. Did not taste quite well. The parantha was a bit soggy and the curry was not up to the mark. The kheer was not sweet enough.

The taste too was horrible.	1	9/26/2018 17:17	√† √©viter d'urgence	Le Dragon Rouge	Hospitality and service: 1	2018-12-27	Kimchi	13.31	18	20	Sarah Durand

How can I say anything good. None of my instructions given were followed. And when tried to contact they don‚Äôt reply.

Ordered two wraps for dinner. They filled my appetites quite well. I really would appreciate the way packing was done, and if your tongue prefers spicy meals, you also get an option of spicy masala.Jumbo Veg Wrap - 4.5/5 was quite delectable, it included paneer, onion, potatoes mashed masala, mayonnaise.Cheese melt paneer wrap - 3/5 had too much of cheese, although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine, but in comparison to the one above I expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue.EditOrdered Navratra Royal Meal -5/5 yesterday , the quality of food was extremely delicious, packaging of fasoos has always been appreciable. The meal was suffice for two people. I look forward to ordering more and more from fasoos, I'm extremely glad with their service.	4	8/29/2018 21:37	recommand√©	Le Moulin √† Frites	Hospitality and service: 4	2018-11-25	Tarte au riz	26.13	9	11	Lison Li
