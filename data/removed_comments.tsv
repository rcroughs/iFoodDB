I had ordered the Cheesy Chicken Bhuna Wrap and the Jumbo Chicken Wrap from here. This was by invitation only and was for tasting. The Cheesy Wrap was great and was filled with cheese in every bite. The Chicken Jumbo Wrap actually had loads of chicken with my favorite variety being the chicken meatball. This is definitely a must try and is also a part of their Signature Wraps.	4	10/4/2018 8:23	recommandé	Le Panda Gourmand	Hospitality and service: 5	2018-12-12	Biryani;Hainanese Chicken Rice;Nasi Goreng;Hainanese Chicken Rice	84.21	16	19	Charlotte Ortega	Avis offensant

Ordered Jumbo Paneer Tikka Rice Fest. First of all it was nowhere near to being jumbo. Simply a small box and they call it ‘Jumbo’. Probably they have studied English from some remote island.

Ordered two wraps for dinner. They filled my appetites quite well. I really would appreciate the way packing was done, and if your tongue prefers spicy meals, you also get an option of spicy masala.Jumbo Veg Wrap - 4.5/5 was quite delectable, it included paneer, onion, potatoes mashed masala, mayonnaise.Cheese melt paneer wrap - 3/5 had too much of cheese, although sprinkled with the spicy masala it tasted fine, but in comparison to the one above I expected something of equivalent taste to my tongue.EditOrdered Navratra Royal Meal -5/5 yesterday , the quality of food was extremely delicious, packaging of fasoos has always been appreciable.

Since my childhood, I've always been a fan of gongura with non veg and when I got to know that this place serves a good Gongura Biryani, thought of having it.And then comes a day when I finally ordered it and guess what, as soon as you see it, you'll fall in love with the colour of biryani 😍 Hopefully that is not an artificial colour. But coming to taste, it's awesome. Just lyk God is omnipotent, the flavour of Gongura is omnipresent😉 I mean in every rice grain you can sense it. The chicken pieces too were very good. They are soft too as one my friends who has a fence to her teeth😜 could eat those easily 😂Tagged at a moderate price , quantity is quite sufficient.If you're a lover of Gongura , then this a must try.NOTE: I don't have any idea about ambience . My rating confined to Gongura biryani alone as I haven't had anything else from there.P.S. I still have this doubt how the chef managed to get that color to the biryani 🤔🤔🤔	4	12/16/2018 1:50	recommandé	Le Palais des Saveurs	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-09-11	Dim Sum	21.47	14	17	Enzo Alvarez	Avis offensant

I didn't try too many things from here but Chicken Dum Biryani was good. Quantity was very good if you are a single person then it is too much and for two people it's not very enough you would need to get a shake or something with it. It's not like you will be hungry but you won't be full till neck(that's how I like eating biryani). If two persons are just normal eater then it's a win-win.	4.0	10/14/2018 11:58	recommandé	Le Petit Café	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-09-19	Tartare de boeuf;Salade Lyonnaise;Salade Lyonnaise	37.39	20	23	Paul Guerin	Avis offensant

Nestled between the hustle bustle of Gachibowli is a small cafe OMBC. One of the very few places in the city with amazing cookies and bagels. Having visited the cafe a handful of times, some of our favourites include the everything bagel, chocochip cookies, margherita pizza and the banana cake. Although the staff is sweet and accommodating, the service is a little slow at times. Sometimes we have received our pizzas before the muffins. We highly recommend this place. This place is perfect for an outing with friends or even for work meetings and offers a wide range of choice from savoury to sweets. One of our favourites in the city.	4.0	5/19/2019 17:43	recommandé	Le Palais des Saveurs	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-08-02	Dim Sum;Biryani	31.04	13	15	Clémence Dupont	Avis mensonger
One of the best places to fill your stomach with. This place is a treat in case you are a sweet tooth. The food is quite good but can never be compared to the sweet delicacies. The tuna sandwich is a win if you like sea food.

Absolutely pathetic. I placed an order for half kg mocha walnut cake. The order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp. When I called the next day to collect the cake, they could not find my order. I had to call multiple times and finally I was told my order is ready. Upon reaching the outlet, the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me. When I asked them if this is really mocha walnut, they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake. They even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much I have already paid. Upon reaching home when the cake was cut, we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch!! The outlet cheated me and so I called them and blasted over phone. I reached the outlet at 10:30 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back, I was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a b'day cake. The store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them. Never ever going back and I strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk. I will, for sure, completely avoid this place.	1.0	5/16/2019 18:53	à éviter d'urgence	Brasserie de la Gare	Hospitality and service: 1	2020-03-09	Tartare de boeuf;Blanquette de lotte;Blanquette de lotte	73.42	18	21	Gaspard Morales	Avis mensonger
Went to this place for lunch. Ordered and paid, waited for 25 minutes and realise that order has not been placed. The place had more people serving than the people eating and yet this happened and everyone was blaming everyone else. There were flies all over the place. Poor show.

Have heard good things about this place. So wanted to give a try. Went in and sat, no one even approached us. Ordered a Chicken Omelette, Mushroom omelette and filter coffee. The food was decent, but the service needs to improve. Had some mosquitoes, the tables were not cleaned promptly after the guests left. The same guy who was cleaning the tables brought us coffee bare hands, wish he’d wear gloves.

They sever a good variety of bread and other baking products but only selected items are good.

I went very late to this place. Maybe post dinner time. So the kitchen was almost closed. I ordered double cheese Margherita pizza, one cheese and chilli toast and a hot chocolate. And the best was hot chocolate. It tasted like heaven on earth. It was the best. The next would be cheese and chilli toast. Very cheesy, and yunm. Pizza was normal authentic Italian. Quite bland but really good. Obviously thin crust. And the ambience was not great, but pretty good cute setting.

Staying in ramky towers we frequent this place quite often. Although little did we know how incredibly disrespectful the staff really is. We found a hair in an ice cube inside the iced tea, when informed the staff on the counter about it , they willingly accepted it without checking. 10 minutes later one of the staff folks comes back saying  are you sure there is a hair . Only to find out they had removed the ice cube which had the hair. After quite a discussion they brought the executive chef ( who literally just stood there with absolutely no contribution to the discussion) eventually when one of the staff's members (nandu in the photo) asserted that he'll personally pay for it we asked for the owner's contact, who then waived off the bill. All in all sincerely disappointed with the attitude of the staff.	1.0	11/17/2018 13:02	à éviter d'urgence	La Trattoria	Delivery: 1	2019-08-21	Ossobuco alla Milanese;Dim Sum	35.4	13	14	Léane Torres	Avis mensonger

We ordered a double Margherita Pizza and white sauce pasta. The texture of white sauce was off and it was very clumpy (the pasta was still very hot). The pizza was fine taste wise but it can't be called a Margherita pizza (had few strands of shredded basil that was dry). All the sachets of oregano seasoning expired 3 months ago, in June and when we opened the sachets there were a lot of clumps. It's okay not to give any seasoning if you don't have it but sending expired stuff is completely unacceptable. The delivery and packing was good.

Ignored this restaurant for almost a year thinking that it would be a regular bakery. But now I regret.They make amazing pizzas and so many authentic cakes. Ambiance is cool.

This place has freshly baked stuff, probably the best you'd find in this locality but the beverages are just about average!The Danish custard and banana cake have made their place permanent in my orders since I am quite frequent here. All cheese puff had a very soft texture but came with a lot of chilli's. The mushroom spinach puff is good. Special omlette didn't really match my expectations here. For the main course, I've tried tuna melt sandwich, egg salad sandwich, double cheese margherita pizza, smoke chicken cherry and mushrooms pizza and red sauce pasta and all of them were good. So all my points go for the food here.Capuccino, latte or filter coffee for that matter didn't really please me. Even the peach iced tea wasn't that great.Pretty Ambience, good food and not that great drinks!	4.0	9/8/2018 20:12	recommandé	La Maison du Pho	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-07-15	Kimchi;Kung Pao Chicken	18.490000000000002	7	8	Julien Alvarez	Avis mensonger

The Old Madras Baking Company. How posh does it sound and what a spectacular ambience. This place is a must try for breakfast lovers! 😎They have really amazing bread rolls and bakery items available for purchase. I’ve tried their garlic bread, the English bread, their croissants, Chocolate muffins, custard and chocolate danish, brownies: all worth it!Over breakfast, I tried the triple cheese sandwich- found it quite average, the white sauce pasta was delicious though. I’ve also tried the mushroom sandwich with other veggies: super amazing!Although the price point is probably a little on the higher side, it’s worth a try!🙂	4.0	8/31/2018 21:50	recommandé	Le Bistrot du Coin	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-03-18	Brandade de morue	29.48	10	13	Jules Santos	Avis mensonger
Whenever I crave to have a good cup of coffee, this is the place i want to head to!Their Madras coffee is soothing, refreshing and amazing!!I tried their cappuccino, but i will go back to have the Madras coffee again probably!!They bake their own breads, so the sandwiches are a must try!We ordered grilled chicken sandwich and egg sandwich with focaccia bread and trust me they were mouth watering!! The stuffing was adequate, and it had the PERFECT crunch!!Also i will vouch for their grilled chicken salad. It is loaded with chicken and veggies and are so filling!!They also have counter with freshly baked cakes, muffins, breads and cookies!!So, though the menu isn’t that elaborate but whatever they are offering it is quite good!!Price wise its ok with the quality and the quantity of the stuff they are providing!They have both indoor and outdoor seating area..so do choose according to the weather outside!!Though the service is bit slow, you can relax by sipping a cup of coffee...chatting away or reading a book in cafe!!

We had gone to Old Madras Baking Company in the past for buying bread but never sat down and had a meal there. We were out on a Saturday morning to check out a house right opposite this place. It was raining and my husband wanted to have some coffee and that is how we landed up here. The place is very chilled out, there was no one at our table to check what we wanted to order despite the place being almost empty.My husband placed the order for us,a mushroom omelette for me and a roasted mushroom makhani sandwich for him. I'm usually not a coffee person but the weather demanded a hot beverage and filter coffee was the first thing that came to my mind. We ordered 2 filter coffees and 1 bagel with cream cheese. The bagel was amazing with the coffee. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese but my husband is and he loved it. We made a pact to go for breakfast every Saturday mornings after this because I realised what an important meal I was missing due to my laziness :)Would recommend this place to everyone for sure. I for sure am going back again for the bagels and coffee!	5.0	7/21/2018 14:27	recommandé	Restaurant Tokyo	Hospitality and service: 4	2018-11-23	Bibimbap;Tom Yum;Satay;Satay	80.48	10	12	Camille Duval	Avis mensonger

The Old Madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor.The coffee is quite good, with a lot of variations available. The best part is the freshly baked breads. Those beautiful, soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter. Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have.Coming to the worst part - the service. In all my visits over the past couple of months, this has been the biggest turn off about this place. Almost always, I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over. Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating. More often than not, you can see flies buzzing over the tables. Though the kitchen looks quite hygienic.	3.0	7/8/2018 23:08	déconseillé	Le Bistrot Asiatique	Delivery: 4	2019-05-13	Gyoza	16.46	13	15	Margot Marquez	Avis offensant

This place is located near the HDFC Bank inside the Meenakshi Bamboos Commercial complex in the Gachibowli area. I went there along with a friend as I read great reviews about their Doughnuts and Cakes.My First impression about this place was that it had a nice decor and relaxed seating areas, both indoor and outdoor. We went there around 1 p.m. and it was very hot, so we opted for sitting indoor.We tried many cakes, cookies and doughnuts here and I liked most of them but my favorite are:a) Red Velvet Doughnut [Rs.60] which was freshly baked and was stuffed with gooey cream filling.b) Salted Nutella Doughnut [Rs.75] which was very soft and stuffed with Nutella.c) Banana Cake [Rs.155] which was moist, soft and cake like sweet bread.d) Dark Chocolate Cookie [Rs.50] which was once again very soft but was not too sweet.epicureantales.com	4.0	6/28/2018 0:14	à éviter d'urgence	Le Lotus Bleu	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-04-24	Gyoza;Gyoza;Curry Laksa	63.88	19	22	Noé Hernandez	Avis mensonger

They really need to improve on the service front, it took the restaurant more than half an hour to prepare a coffee and a sandwich. There were no menus in the seating area.

I tried this places called Old Madras Baking Company and was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and quality of food. Ordered a mushroom sandwich which came in brown bread with a pinch of basil and tomato sauce. The filling had bell peppers and there was no extra grease which was the best part.They bake fresh bread everyday and each of their items look so good. There is a variety of options like bagels, custard buns, brownies and croissants. I also tried their multi grain bread which has flax seeds, millets and other healthy seeds.

Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker! The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!	5	11/27/2018 2:38	recommandé	Le Petit Belge	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-09-16	Stoofvlees;Couques de Dinant;Moules-frites	39.54	15	18	Emma Li	Avis mensonger

Went for a casual with my roomie to this place. The ambience was nice and looked like a good restaurant. Ordered Chicken Shorba, which is similar to soup prepared in chicken stew and pepper. For starters ordered Tandoori murgh Adraki, it was served hot and really delightful. The taste was awesome and chicken was properly tandoored. In the same course we ordered the usual tandoori roti and Murg tikka lababdar. Murg tikka was awesome, it was not too spicy nor too blunt, it was perfect gravy with boneless chicken.Only word of advice for the management is PLEASE STOP APPLYING GST ON PRODUCTS SOLD AT MRP SUCH AS COLD DRINKS AND WATER BOTTLES.

Dum biryani @ it's finest. They wrap up the hyderabadi flavour quite well and have started to be known in the biryani and food circles of Hyderabad now.Ordered Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani for a late lunch 2.0 😂 today. They did not dissapoint me and I am happy I chose this place to order.For a good, lip smacking tasty hyderabadi dum biryani, you may definitely go ahead and order from them.Their packaging and service is also neat and hygienic.

Nice little place for lunch parties. We were almost 100 people and went for lunch buffet. The ambiance is okayish nothing to write about but seating arrangement is quite spacious. Coming to food we were served with 3 starters chicken malai kebab, chicken lollipop and Apollo fish. All of three were awesome also the vegetarian ones also tasted nice. Didn't try main course much as I was enough but there were enough varieties in chicken mutton and prawn. In desert there was one kheer and one Gil a firdoos really well made.

We had Murgh Musallam and it's really awesome. The gravy which is prepared is super tasty 😍😍😍.. chicken was cooked well and tender 😋😋😋 if you are a chicken lover, can try atleast once... The quantity is enough for 2...

'Say no more!'Food - The name itself will get any Hyderabadis taste buds jiggle! And certainly it stood up to it's name, the food here was delectable!I'll list out my favorites first, In the starters I just fell in love with the Murgh Kalmi Kebab, chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture, it was delicious and it is a #musttry on my list! I jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical, likewise Yakhni Shorba (Indianized Mutton Soup) was a great way to get things started! It had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job! Sabz Ki Shaami, a mashed vegetable mixture, fried in oil, served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter. Paneer Achari Kebab wasn't the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this, otherwise the flavor is pretty good! Gosht Sheekh Kebab, a classic, the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender, felt it was a bit dry though. Patrani Fish, wrapped inside a banana (I'm guessing) leaf, was topped with a layer of mint chutney, although the fish was heavenly, I'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney! Tandoori Jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second #musttry starter!The drinks got mixed reactions! Well 60% of them being below average and another 40% being extraordinary, it was a rollercoaster in this dept.! We gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us Cinderella, Caramel Mint Mojito and Mint Cooler which just blew us all away! I hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well!The main course had us dying! We were already so full and there was plenty of food left! Gosht Achari, Murgh Achari, the former being a lil more spicier, were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans, there's nothing better than this combination! Nargisi Kofta was another curry, couldn't differentiate much when compared to the other two.Special mention goes to 'Sikendari Raan' for ₹1490, it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides! If you're a lamb lover then it is something that'll satisfy all your Mutton cravings! Food gets a solid 10/10! Need to work on the drinks though!Ambiance - It is a huge property just opposite to SLN Terminus. With ground and first floor seating, it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once! Although the place is well lit, I didn't feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture! 'Hyderabadi Daawat' should incorporate anything and everything Hyderabad has to offer in it's culture as nobody else in that area are doing that! I had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic Lungi, have Marfa (Hyderabadi Band Baaja) outside on the weekends, but the classy interiors just don't allow this to happen! Well you never know, I'm not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy! Ambiance gets 8/10!Service - It was decent! As they're pretty fresh in the market, they'll have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste! The food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then! I'd like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order! The waiters, butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have! Overall service gets 8/10!Why Hyderabadi Daawat? #authenticWill I Specially go to HD?

It's always good to see restaurants which focus on Hyderabadi cuisine since it's so diverse and encompasses a lot of different varieties within it. Hyderabadi Daawat does justice to it's name but treating us to good Hyderabadi food.The restaurant is located on the Gachibowli - Kondapur mainroad with convenient parking. The interiors are classy and comfortable.The dish that started off the Daawat was the Yakhni Shorbha which was meticulously done - spicy, meaty and the meat was literally falling apart from the bone.Achari paneer - seasoned with pickle masalas and was just cooked to perfection.Sabz ki Shami - the textures felt a little strange to me.Tandoori Aaloo- soft and fluffy stuffed potatos with crispy grilled skins on the exteriorMurgh Kalmi kebab - marinated chicken in mild spices grilled to perfection in a tandoor.Gosht Seekh Kebab- it is extremely easy to dry out a Seekh Kebab but they nail it here.Patrani fish and tandoori Jhinga needed a improvement as they lacked depth of flavour and taste.Their main course comprised of Murgh Mussalam, Nargisi Kofta, Achari Murgh, Shahi Paneer, Dal Akbari, Gosht Masala.Their Sikandari Raan and Murgh Mussalam deserve a special mention.A variety of mocktails are available out of which my personal favourites happen to be the Lemon mint cooler, Cinderella ( slightly on the sweeter side) and Coco Baliney.Their service was exceptional where the minutest details were taken care of.	4	10/31/2018 23:59	recommandé	Le Petit Bouchon	Hospitality and service: 0	2019-05-13	Salade Lyonnaise	15.94	16	17	Célia Sá	Avis mensonger
The name is a giveaway here! This place specialises in Hyderabadi cusinie and we were here for a food review session.Ambience- Decent with ample space. It's a fine dine place you can visit with your family.Food- This place has lots of splendid non vegetarian options but being a vegetarian, my review revolves around their veg food and beverages.The food was well prepared and presented overall. I liked the achari paneer tikka in starters. Shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti Basket. Two of my favourite beverages from the evening were Caramel Mojito and Lemon Mint.The menu is vast and really reasonable. Do not miss this place if you like Hyderabadi cusinie. Even if you're not a fan, do give them a chance as they have a lot to offer at really humble rates.Follow Unsophisticated Foodies on Instagram and Facebook for more reviews and pictures :)	4	10/31/2018 23:02	recommandé	La Cocina Mexicana	Delivery: 4	2019-04-27	Carnitas;Carnitas	37.53	16	19	Nathan Figueira	Avis offensant
I have always been a fan of regional cuisines of India for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition. And its not just the flavours on the taste buds, its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization. And with the imprint Nizams have left on the city of Hyderabad in every aspect, it doesn't even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in Hyderabadi cuisine.Hyderabadi Dawaat is one new joint in Gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of Nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite Hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights.Coming to the food, I went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba which was a flavour-pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal. With every sip, the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue.Then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg. From the vegetarian ones, I personally loved the Achaari Paneer Tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it. From the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the Murgh Kalmi Kebab - chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection, Gosht Seekh Kebab - plain old mutton kebabs with juicy, succulent mutton mince and Patrani Fish - fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade, wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor.From among the specialties from the area, the restaurant presented us with their Sikandari Rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, pepper and cashew nut, finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage - tender, juicy and delicious. In a similar fashion, restaurant also serves specialty big platters like Chelo Kebabs which is a Persion styled serving of Mutton and Chicken Kebabs on a bed of Saffron Rice and Murg Mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender, served again on a bed of rice.Even after the Rann, the show wasn't over and we went in for mains trying out their Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which went really well with some hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. Nargisi Kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion-tomato gravy. Gosht Masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the Kofta and had flavourful bone-in mutton pieces. With the Achari Chicken, the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn't too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be. Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note, both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good.The service here at Hyderabadi Dawaat was just as good as their food. The staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates. I was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best. In a nutshell, if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of Hyderabad on a plate, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!instagram.com	4	10/31/2018 22:56	recommandé	Le Bistrot des Copains	Hospitality and service: 5	2018-11-09	Poulet basquaise;Galette complète;Crème brûlée	61.99	10	11	Charlotte Gonzalez	Avis mensonger

Hyderabadi Cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition(s) like any other cuisine. Generations after generation, the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such. But there is more than just biryani and kebab(s). Once you get to taste real authentic dishes, you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of Nizams. You always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the Cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies. Wait no more as kondapur-gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while. Hyderabadi Daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab(s) and biryani. My dinner session today had no expectation(s) from it but then the food spoke for itself. Restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don't get that easily anywhere in vicinity.Dishes like #MurghMussalam , #MurghKalmiKebab, #CheloKebab, #PatraniFish, #GoshtMasala, #SikanderRaan and many more. While a few dishes went amiss to excite me, all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that's used to typical tandoor/kebab(s). Must Try : #AchariChicken, #GoshtMasala, #KalmiKebab, #PaneerAchari, #DalAkbari and #NargasiKoftaDo focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and I'm sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich Hyderabadi Daawat Cuisine. I'm definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service (Mainly Mr. Dilawar was so gracious)#GastroHogger #LetsHog #HyderabadiDawaat #DawaatDelicacies #CyberabadCelebrationsgastrohogger.com	4	10/31/2018 1:33	recommandé	Le Moulin à Vent	Hospitality and service: 3	2019-03-11	Brandade de morue	15.47	9	11	Léana Tran	Avis mensonger

A newbie in the neighborhood calls for a visit and it was a Sunday afternoon we landed.A quick confirmation via Zomato led to happy welcome as we enjoyed the ambiance and amazing hospitality by the courteous staff.Menu card was well organized with tabs to make your way through it easier. Earned a 1/2 star!Ordered Pathar-Gosht and Afghan Kebab as wanted to start off light. As surprising as it can be the Afghan Kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities. Pathar-Gosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth. Another Star earned for Starters.When in Hyd go for Biryani- So how couldn't we as we ordered Biryanis - Chicken and Mutton. Prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time !Taste was good as they took care that the Biryani don't fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye. Happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces. Spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing. The colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the Typical Hyderabadi style.With tummies full we ordered Blue Mojito and it too scored as expected...Amazing. Time for a wrap up as the Manager Mr. Dilawar greeted us with his hospitality. A true Gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout.My View: An amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with Family and friends. Located conveniently in Main road to Gachibowli, Daawat is a must try if you're around or visiting Hyd. When in Daawat- don't forget to try their Pathar-Gosht and not to forget the Amazing Raan they boast of being their super speciality.Food: 4*Ambiance 4.5 *Budget Friendly : 4*Staff Hospitality: 5*Happy Fooding !	4	10/1/2018 14:58	recommandé	La Maison du Sushi	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-01-22	Tempura;Nasi Goreng;Nasi Goreng	59.82	7	9	Thibaut White	Avis offensant

the restaurant ambiance was really spacious and cozy. But the food was not so good. the starter veg kabab platter, the paneer was really hard only the aloo was good. we directly went for veg and chicken biryani. which was okay but not so good to. the service was good. i forgot to mention the mocktails that were mojito and ginger peach they were a bit to sweet.	2	9/24/2018 7:15	déconseillé	Le Bistro du Quartier	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-01-29	Bouef à la mode	22.03	16	17	Manon Petit	Avis offensant
A newly opened Daawat restaurant on Kondapur road. We visited on Saturday evening without prior booking. The decor is elegant and spacious with comfortable sitting.We ordered Mojito and Ginger peach mocktails along with Daawat khas veg kebab platter. Mocktails were good but little too sweet. Veg platter was good but nothing excellent. Paneer particularly wasn't so fresh. We directly went for Veg and Chicken dum Biryanis. Again, both were just ok and quality of rice was just ordinary.Overall the ambience and service is good but food is just average and not so rich. You can visit this place for casual dining with friends and families.	3	9/23/2018 17:52	déconseillé	Le Chat Noir	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-06-26	Chicons au gratin	18.02	10	12	Simon Joly	Avis offensant
My husband and I, visited Zega for their dimsum festival and we were not disappointed.The service started with a delicious bowl of thukpa, which had a perfect blend of spice. Followed by an array of dimsums, each being delicious and warm. The chicken Gyoza was absolutely mind blowing. I could eat a zillion of those!The dimsums (which we were full after) were followed by the main course which included fried rice/soft noodle with chicken and fish(we did not try the vegetarian dishes)The cherry on the cake was the dessert! Toffee banana with ice Cream. Ugh! Delicious!!Our bill was ~ 1700/- for 2Worth every penny.Ambience-5/5Taste-5/5Value for money-5/5(surprisingly)Service-4.5/5Will I visit again? Yes, maybe for a different food festival this time!	5	5/21/2019 20:36	à éviter d'urgence	Le Cercle des Gourmets	Hospitality and service: 2	2020-02-01	Lapin à la Kriek	8.68	12	13	Zoé Anderson	Avis offensant

Zega is a beautiful Pan Asian restaurant located amidst the lavish property of Sheraton Hyderabad. The restaurant has got a great ambiance to it and serves some of the authentic Pan Asian dishes that one could ask for.I went there for their ongoing Dimsum food festival with my pals and had a great time overall. The Dimsum food festival had a variety of Thukpa options ranging from Chicken, Mutton, Pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from China. Next up, there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts.The first thing to try out was their Chicken Thukpa. It was simply delicious. The broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet, spice and tang into it which was amazing. The amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall, it was an absolute winner. This was something I personally recommend all of you to try.Next up, we were offered some of their Dimsums. The showstopper of the day were Pan fried Chicken Gyoza, Pok choi roasted garlic and Napa Cabbage Crystals, Prawn crystal wraps and Vegetable beijing dumpling. The Prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try.For mains, we ordered for Wok tossed Chicken in Dry chilli cashews, Crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side Vegetable fried rice and Vegetable wok tossed soft noodles. The Chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful. It was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef. Overall, the main course was good and had clean, authentic flavors.With out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached, we decided to go ahead with their Toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream. This was magical. I have been a lover of Toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing. The creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate.All in all, it is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy a great layout of Pan Asian food. The staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing. Happy eating. :)	4	5/13/2019 11:07	à éviter d'urgence	L'Auberge Provençale	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-05-22	Crème brûlée;Clafoutis aux cerises;Brandade de morue	45.56	13	14	Romain Vásquez	Avis mensonger
It's been a very long desire to taste the pan Asian food at Zega, very beautiful place with a spectacular view from the outlet, well balanced ambience with nice live kitchen and interactive bar, coming to the service its seems very low manned for every order we have to stand up and request someone to attend for our request, taste of the food was just ok, need to relook into the clasic dishes, over all it was a very average dining experience at zega.	2	5/9/2019 22:15	déconseillé	La Crêperie Parisienne	Hospitality and service: 0	2020-03-05	Pain bagnat	28.04	10	11	Léo Liu	Avis offensant

It was an IPL Sunday evening when we went to this place, the food tastes really good unlike other 4-5 star hotel restaurants where food is average. Ambience was just ok as it was too dull according to me. The highlight of this place is its open till late night 2 am and has an amazing roof top.We order 1 veg and 3 non veg starters and all were perfectly done. Specially mention for Butter garlic fish (if u like buttery flavour) which was just superb.The only thing which I didn’t like was the portion size which was too less.And yes you get booze served here even on dry days 😉	4	4/23/2019 17:13	recommandé	Le Café Mexicain	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-07-04	Polenta;Guacamole;Cochinita Pibil;Guacamole	69.67	18	21	Léo White	Avis offensant

I had visited Zega on Weekdays for Lunch few times earlier and felt underwhelmed overall. Last visit for a Sunday dinner changed the perception however. First of all, the ambiance comes alive in the night with a lounge like feel, and even the otherwise boring corporate concrete jungle around seems better in the night from a height. I am guessing they put their best efforts on a weekend compared to weekdays as the food quality was significantly better. Food order was two varieties of veg sushis (the crispy one was very well made), soft noodles, and a coconut based Thai curry (which was neither too sweet nor heavy on the stomach, very well made overall). And the place was quite packed as well making it lively. Overall, worth visiting.	4	4/8/2019 13:15	recommandé	Le Bistro du Quartier	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-05-12	Bouef à la mode;Tartare de boeuf	30.57	16	18	Kylian Durand	Avis mensonger

Was waiting for longtime to be @Zega with the rating it possesed. B&B, Zega Mojito,Herbal Delight,Oriental Fantasy , Blushing Dragon were ok but not that great! Chilli chicken, fish, paneer were also of subtle taste. The lamb starter should have been more soft & in eatable consistency. Egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt. Veg Thai Curry was ok to some extent. Diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste. Schezwan veg fried rice was below average. Somehow not satisfied with the quality of food served or the flavours or the service.Disappointing for the price paid and the food we had.	3	3/21/2019 11:47	déconseillé	La Brasserie Flamande	Hospitality and service: 4	2020-02-10	Filet américain;Boulets à la liégeoise;Filet américain;Filet américain	64.1	14	15	Agathe Pérez	Avis mensonger

I’ve visited this place located on the tenth floor of Sheraton hotel for a Sunday lunch at 3 pm. Should I say the service was slightly ignorant?

This luxurious restaurant is located in one of the most posh areas of Hyderabad. Situated on the 10th floor of Sheraton, the extravaganza starts right from its entrance. Unlike it's location, it is not too economical, neither expensive to skint you out of money. The ambiance is subtle, dim lights and decorated with fancy wooden furniture to add the extra wowness. The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!!

This is a fantastic place. I rated them 1 star on my first visit. They were apologetic (invited me again immediately) and I didn’t show up until after 10months because of the traumatic first visit. They have upped their standards significantly since. Best hot and sour soup on par with any Chinatown joint across the world - bamboo shoots, shiitake mushroom and all the works. Gyoza is good. Heck everything they served was good on my second visit. Special shoutout to the lady who mixes the drinks - a true professional. Her Nirvana cocktail is just that - sinful pleasure. I went there on consecutive weekends. Tip - go during the day because it is well lit and has a wonderful view outside. I will be there again. Cost is very reasonable for the place which is a very pleasant surprise. I will be there again for some more of the Nirvana potion.	5	12/4/2018 22:13	recommandé	Brasserie de la Gare	Delivery: 2	2019-01-28	Blanquette de lotte;Navarin d'agneau	47.75	16	17	Océane Ramos	Avis mensonger

Been to Zega about 5 times now and have stuck to the same choice of orders - Celery Dimsums, Som Tam, Thai Green Curry and Pad Thai. Although the proportions are quite small, the food is lip smacking good. It is authentic and a delight to my taste buds. The ambience is beautiful with calming elements. This my go-to comfort food restaurant that I would recommend to anyone looking for authentic pan Asian cuisine!	5	9/10/2018 12:12	recommandé	Chez Pierre	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-06-25	Salade Lyonnaise;Bouef à la mode	43.37	20	23	Baptiste Roussel	Avis mensonger

I've been to this place long back with one of my friend. Never though of writing a review about my visit but when I came across couple of pictures which were captured there, made me to write this. I would rate this place 4/5 for food beacuse the fried rice that we have ordered, though it was tasty it is oily. For the service this would deserve 5/5 because from the time I've entered I was heartfully welcomed by the hostess and was shown a proper place for seating. And the bar man was so interactive with us which actually misses in other bars. When I have to write about the ambience, this place deserves a bow. Ambience inside the bar is awesome but the ambience from the rooftop would be mind blowing. Would love to go there again and again.	5	8/16/2018 23:06	recommandé	La Boulangerie	Hospitality and service: 4	2018-09-20	Pot-au-feu;Pot-au-feu;Pain bagnat;Bouef à la mode	67.29	10	13	Timéo Roux	Avis offensant

Sheraton is a big brand in the Hotel Industry and famous for its cuisines! One of the best place for a fine dine experience, the restaurant is of high class with a gigantic bar.The seating is decent, food menu has limited options, yet the flavors are deep rooted.Order some Keema patty, Keema Pao and Cheese maggi.

This place is good unless you look at the menu card. It's like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend. 900 rs for a glass of wine ? Well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for 400 a glass.But if you're a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this.DJ plays some really nice music.And one advantage is that this place is opened till 2 am.	3	7/3/2018 0:15	déconseillé	La Maison du Sushi	Hospitality and service: 5	2018-08-17	Boulettes à la sauce tomate	21.38	9	11	Esteban Fernández	Avis mensonger

Would not like to even give 1* as Service was pathetic. Staff was appearing to be busy and had no courtesy to attend our table in the centre of the restaurant. Starters were served after main dish though they were ordered much before. One of the staff half served a dish to a couple of guests on our table and hopped to other table without finishing her task without any apology. We had to keep on asking for a dish (Sushi) which was ordered 90 mins. before it was served.

There are places that deserve a 5 star but they're worth a single visit. This one's different. The restaurant experience was 5 star indeed and deserves multiple visits. The food taste and quality exceeded the expectations. The presentation was great. Nice and courteous waiting with quick service.However, the security of the hotel (Sheraton) in which this marvellous diner was in, did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called Zega. Also, there's no elevator from the underground parking space.It was a 5 star experience for the restaurant, the ambience and the food. But I cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance.Anyway. It's a must visit. I apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5. But, I really had no choice based on the inconvenience at the entrance.	4	5/28/2018 22:20	recommandé	Le Café du Commerce	Delivery: 1	2019-05-19	Galette complète;Choucroute garnie	34.73	10	12	Emma Richard	Avis mensonger

We went for a family dinner on 15th April. Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba. Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. However we went inside and opted for a buffet. The food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. The most annoying thing was the on the table service. The table wasnt ready when we were seated. We had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. Multiple times. The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean. The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star.	3	4/17/2018 15:55	déconseillé	Le Château de Cuisine	Hospitality and service: 3	2018-05-08	Canard à l'orange;Blanquette de lotte;Pot-au-feu	67.27	15	18	Noé Vásquez	Avis mensonger

Had been there for lunch on a Friday afternoon. they have a very cosy atmosphere with a wonderful view of the Gachibowli Road from atop the 10th floor. Their food was something that we thoroughly enjoyed. we had their awesome tyangra style hakka fired prawns which was sweet and mildly spicy. there were about 6 chunky prawns in a plate. Their Maki salmon sushi was great as well if not the best. Then we had the Chinese barbecue Pork belly ribs which was chunky, succulent and juicy. in short, we had a really great meal and look forward to a second visit there soon.	4	4/10/2018 23:11	recommandé	Chez André	Hospitality and service: 3	2018-10-16	Boulets à la liégeoise	12.51	9	12	Julien Duarte	Avis offensant

Great place to hangout with friends. Some of the best Asian food you can get in this area. I really like the Kung Pao chicken and their signature lamb chops.

The chutney, dahi and pickles came is separate containers and the parantha were packed so well and were piping hot.Coming over to the taste, I would say i loved it. The aloo parantha was excellent. The corn cheese parantha was good too but i couldn't find any cheese in that parantha. I guess i would never order corn and cheese parantha again.

Full marks for packaging and the way they serve you 2 big fat aloo parathas ( just the way they should be) with pickles, butter, dhania chutney and curd. They actually kept the Punjabi paratha feel alive so thank you for doing total justice to the food you serve.A small complaint would be adding more aloo and not make the dough too thick, but overall, it was wonderful.

I had ordered Manchow Soup. The taste was very nice. It felt like a great start . Crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the Soup, chicken was cooked well, overall a very good subtle starter. The Chilli Chicken Dry was One of the best I've tasted,was kinda smoky, chicken was cooked very well. the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing,cooked to perfection. Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark. the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird. The chicken fried rice was not that great too .

It is overrated casual Chinese food, with lot of oil. You can call it more of Indian Chinese. Ordered wolly chicken average. Flat noodles very oily. Thread chicken was oily. The captain/manager denied us Axis bank card discount because it was not told before. No restaurant denied me that discount before. Quantity is too much and they charged more than what was mentioned in the menu. Seriously it is an overated Indian Chinese restaurant. One star is for the thread chicken starter (oily, fried).	1	5/5/2019 22:59	à éviter d'urgence	L'Auberge Provençale	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-09-27	Brandade de morue	15.49	13	15	Théo Martín	Avis mensonger

We love chinese food and we headed for Chinese Pavilion to have dinner on a Wednesday evening. We reached there by 7:30 and we were the first customers, by 8:30 onwards people started to fill the restaurant. It’s not difficult to find the place since is on the main road.Ambiance is nice, the typical chinese music that goes on is kind of relaxing. Decors have chinese items so it’s not bad.Service was spot on, we were attended very. It didn’t take much time for the food to come out from the kitchen.For food we had Satay Chicken sticks and Spicy Black Bean Lamb for starters, Teppan Soba Noodles Sizzler for main course and cheesecake for desserts. The satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth, really good. The Lamb was good but not wow. The noodles tasted awesome! It came sizzling, buttery and full of flavour. Usually in India is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience. The prices are a bit on the higher side but deserves a try definitely.

Such good place for Chinese food...Ambience: Nice and peaceful.Taste: Very good. I had lemon grass soup since I had a sore throat and it helped me more than I wished for. Lemon, coriander, and chillies have all added to the flavors. The crispy water chestnut starter is sweet but tasty. I could not stop myself from finishing the sweet coriander sauce that had a hint of mint.Teppan soba noodles, a sizzler, is just as good.

Been to this place twice for dinner and haven't been disappointed. We ordered a lemongrass soup, honey potato (please lookup exact names in the menu) to begin with and proceeded to have veg soft noodles and manchurian. The manchurian isn't the desi version that you get in most places so the spice levels can be a let down. But the noodles were thin and light. Overall a delicious meal.

They also provide baby chair which has become a must for me. I ordered everything veg sweet corn soup, veg mini dragon rolls and haka noodles. The sweet corn soup was good and thick and tastes delicious with all vegetables. He veg mini dragons are mini spring rolls that kind of disappointed me as they were very oily. May be it's my personal choice but I wish they are less oily. The haka noodles were the best I have had and loved them to the core.

Not just the food the service in this place is horrible. We ordered crab meat soup which according to the menu was supposed to be spicy.They served us a bland soup and when we enquired about it the captain (person who took the order) said we should taste the soup first before asking.The captain was disrespectful and dismissive also charged us full price for soup that was unpalatable.Needless to say we didn't try anything else there.	1	1/25/2019 20:55	déconseillé	Le Palais Impérial	Hospitality and service: 2	2019-12-16	Bibimbap	15.67	19	21	Jade Roussel	Avis offensant

We have been here on weekend afternoon for lunch as we want to have a authentic Chinese. Nice ambience, less crowded & peaceful environment. Warmly welcomed by staff. Coming to food as we have kid with us, so the dishes we ordered were of less Spice. Ordered some Veg soup, couple of starters. I must say Veg soup was made to perfection, full marks. We didn't like starters; Honey potato was too much on sweeter side than it should be & Babycorn starter has no taste (No salt, No spice). But again Main course specially Egg fried rice was very nice & tasty (could have ordered a bit more spicy one; bcoz it was infromed to us when ordering about the spice level but we ignored, so no complaints). Over all good experience, but spicy levels are far less :)Ambience - 4/5Cleanliness - 5/5Service - 5/5Food (starters) - 2/5Food (Main course) - 4/5Tip: Do check for spicy levels before ordering!!	3	11/25/2018 20:54	recommandé	Le Bistrot de Bruxelles	Hospitality and service: 1	2019-10-08	Pain à la grecque	26.87	8	9	Clément Dupont	Avis offensant
Visited this place on a friday evening. Saw good rating on Zomato and decided to give this place a try.This place has great ambience and decent staff. We ordered veg soup and chicken manchow soup they were good. But if you see the attached image to this review, the cucumber and salad, which i got was not fresh and this had disappointed me. You would expect fresh food on your table, when you pay premium price.We then ordered garlic based noodles (cant remember the name), mongolian chicken and lime soda. The food was great but again, we found the mushrooms in the noodles not fresh and this made me quiet disappointed.Overall i would say the food was great, a bit pricey though. I could not give a great rating because of the things mentioned above.	2	11/25/2018 20:38	déconseillé	Le Bistrot de Liège	Hospitality and service: 4	2019-09-22	Moules-frites;Boulets à la liégeoise	16.74	11	12	Simon Petit	Avis offensant

Ordered Tom yum soup, prawns pepper chilli, fish crispy ginger. Very good soup, Don't understand why u have to use barter prawn ok taste however batter was thick. Fish crispy ginger chilli very disappointing taste less. For Main course ordered Mandarin fish and chicken fried rice, below average food. Over all ok ok place huge difference in taste when compare to banjara hills outlet.	3	8/30/2018 21:50	déconseillé	Restaurant Tokyo	Hospitality and service: 5	2019-04-21	Lasagne al Forno;Bulgogi;Bulgogi	47.79	12	13	Clara Ho	Avis mensonger

Mediocre food .Ordered wanton soup and chicken dimsum.For a crazy dimsum lover , the dish was unappealing as the outer cover was thick , though the chicken portions were decent . The wanton soup was mediocre.What bothered me was the service personnel hurried his way through the order and mentioned that only main course can be served. It was still 15 minutes for the closing time.I just feel some personal touch would have been better.Will explore some more dishes , before commenting further	3	8/14/2018 2:42	déconseillé	El Rancho	Hospitality and service: 1	2018-12-02	Fajitas;Chilaquiles;Miso Soup	64.4	14	17	Lucie Petit	Avis offensant

The place is very well set up with Chinese decor and comfortable seating. Everything on the menu isn't great but few things are exceptionally good. Crispy Mushroom is a must try and for sure will be a delight for the vegetarians.I tried the American chopseuy and will not be recommending that to anyone, tastes really bad and the quality of ingredients used is just not good. Although the service staff was very courteous and welcoming, also they extended their timings for us, but food part needs to be worked upon.	4	6/2/2018 15:52	recommandé	Le Moulin à Vent	Delivery: 4	2019-01-09	Brandade de morue;Bouef à la mode;Pot-au-feu;Bouef à la mode	58.25	10	13	Elisa Sá	Avis mensonger
I was here last night with 2 of my friends. We ordered pan fried noodles, Chinese pavilion noodles pan fried and spicy black bean lamb. Food was spicy and tasted fine. I have had better pan fried. However, the best/worst part follows... All of us had to take a sick leave today as we cannot stop going to the washroom. The food quality needs to be definitely checked. We don't expect this from a restaurant of your stature. Never going back and requesting others the same.	1	5/29/2018 16:02	à éviter d'urgence	Le Petit Bistrot	Hospitality and service: 3	2018-11-25	Soufflé au fromage	20.71	7	9	Rémi Lopez	Avis mensonger

We ordered from here via swiggy:We ordered:Stuffed Mushrooms: They were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. And quantity was great.Mushroom in Shechuan Sauce: We ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, I have never tasted tofu before so I can't say. But we didn't really like it.Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.Fried rice: It was decent with good amount of veggies. Quality of rice was good.Stir fried greens: It was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like Broccoli, Pringle etcAlthough we were disappointed that there was no Mushroom.	4	1/24/2018 13:50	recommandé	La Table d'Amis	Delivery: 2	2018-03-16	Crème brûlée;Pâté en croûte;Tartare de boeuf;Poulet basquaise	68.29	19	22	Eva Chavez	Avis offensant

If its Chinese then it's this place ! No other place in Hyderabad has Chinese food this good ( well at least till now )Let me start of by complementing the service of this place- such a homely and warm feel when each waiter was more than willing to make us comfortable, the owner Mr. Ali, who himself helped us out in deciding what to order based on our pallet. The food was exactly what we wanted wait sorry let me correct myself, it was way better than what we wanted.Our order came in around 15 min ( maybe lesser ) and it consisted of crispy lamb, noodles sautéed in this wonderful butter garlic combination!!, mixed fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce!! The food was exceptionally good ! Each dish was gourmet level and to top it all of we had desserts which was darsaan and ice cream ( the best darsaan I've ever had ).Food and service was mind blowing. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and anyone who wishes to have Chinese. And yes this place is going to become my second house, you'll see me here way too often from today	5	7/23/2017 0:04	recommandé	Le Café des Artistes	Hospitality and service: 5	2018-05-21	Steak frites;Steak frites;Steak frites;Penne all'Arrabbiata	99.73	7	8	Maxence Petit	Avis offensant

Hello, This place was bookmarked for a long time now so I wanted to pay it a visit. And finally the moment came when I was actually able to go there. I am a huge fan of Indo-Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment. I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side. Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there's no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food. Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren't properly fried and rather than giving a good taste, it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering. All in all, the food wasn't enjoyable. Will I visit again? Probably not! I am sorry!

Restaurant serving a Chinese cuisine on gachibowli mehdipatnam road. The food is not so great and doesn't have that authentic taste. The dishes they serve are different but fails to impress interms of presentation, taste and even price.The ambiance is good and doesn't have anything which will make you feel wow.

#Delayedpost (date of visit Jan 10)#FoodShaukeen #ChinesePavilionChinese Pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in Chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a Chinese restaurant, and I wasted no time in suggesting this 😉. Visited Gachibowli branch which is above CCD and is in the same building of Up the Bistro.Their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably.Pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250 - 350 . A tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 AI.Have ordered Manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds. Red Chilli Prawns (dry), BBQ chicken, three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers. Prawns Teppan yaki, pan fried and tossed along with Chilli Garlic and butter tasted real good. BBQ chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better. Show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish, a wonderful combo to your taste buds. Three treasure veggies had broccoli, baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me. Had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces, could have done wonders.Among main course was schezwan fried rice and CP special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce, tasted Okish as sauce did not impress me as much as I expected. Schezwan rice was delicious though, right to the spices. Requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles 😕.Service : Though their service is quick, staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order. Something that is important from customer point of view.Bottomline : there were few misses and few hits. However, most of the dishes were towards sweeter side. I wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception.	3.5	1/22/2017 0:47	recommandé	La Boulangerie	Hospitality and service: 0	2017-06-19	Salade Lyonnaise	10.58	12	13	Léana Ribeira	Avis offensant

Went there with friends.The staff was polite.Had the royal Thai soup veg,loved it.Liked the dumplings but the quantity was just 4 tiny pieces,which was very less. The Hakka noodles were decent.the bamboo rice was not as good as I had expected it.the chestnut curry was okay.overall everything was okay, nothing was bad.	3.5	12/2/2016 10:57	recommandé	La Trattoria	Delivery: 1	2017-03-23	Cannelloni alla Fiorentina;Polenta;Cannelloni alla Fiorentina;Caprese (Insalata Caprese)	65.46	13	16	Robin Rodriguez	Avis mensonger
My favorite Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad. Food is splendid and its never crowded. The waiters are connoisseurs.The Royal Thai Soup is what a soup should be.The Roasted Lamb with Superior Sauce tastes great with the pepper sauce.The Pan fried noodles will make your day.Oh and the chocolate mousse will give you sweet dreams.	5	11/27/2016 21:45	recommandé	El Rancho	Hospitality and service: 3	2017-09-13	Enchiladas;Fajitas;Huevos Rancheros;Huevos Rancheros	69	14	17	Léana Vásquez	Avis offensant
Just went due to the zomato rating. Small place, may be 40-45 seater restaurant. Close to offices. Has valet parking, which most of the small restaurants doesn't have. Staff is courteous. They have a daily course meals round the week. Good option instead of buffets. Every item in the platter is good. Nothing wrong to point out. Lighter on pockets, go for it. with Bhaskar Varada	4	11/26/2016 11:30	recommandé	Le Petit Bouchon	Hospitality and service: 4	2017-02-27	Pain bagnat;Clafoutis aux cerises	23.08	17	18	Laure Thomas	Avis mensonger
Amazing food,good ambience & great service...this is what describes Chinese Pavilion. Their Chinese is blended in Indian flavors & that is what makes it so special! The chopsuey,all chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fish/prawn starters. The best part about their food is it isn't bland,it is mixed with Indian flavors ensuring the Chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy. If you want to try something different within the Chinese cuisine this place won't disappoint you. And the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice. I am going with a 4.5 because I beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and I request every foodie to visit this place. This is honestly one of the few Chinese places that serve chinese cuisine with an Indian touch. Worth a visit any day!	4.5	11/13/2016 9:39	recommandé	Le Dragon Rouge	Hospitality and service: 2	2017-05-27	Pad Thai;Kimchi;Miso Soup;Pad Thai	89.54	17	18	Clara Santos	Avis offensant

Chinese Cuisine including diverse styles from various parts of chine has not only influenced the food landscape in various parts of Asia but across the world. One of the most simple yet complicated in flavor profiles. India has also embraced so much of Asian cuisine that you can vouch that most of Indian Foodie community next to their regional cuisine would be fans of Chinese Cuisine. Chinese Pavilion is one of the most consistent brand in Hyderabad that you keep hearing for authentic no non-sense Chinese dishes at not to alarming prices and yet have strong fan following.  I for one of them was a fan as I dined here last year and fate had me to dine her with Fellow Foodie Bhais exactly after a year and I had to be blown away by the food only to believe that no wonder this place has been awarded The Best Chinese Restaurant 2016 from Times Of India . Big bow to Owner Mr. Sayed Ali and also our foodie Guru Taher bhai for making our menu selection so easy and making it one of the memorable dinner in recent times hands down. ...Read full post on gastrohogger.com	4.5	10/11/2016 10:10	recommandé	Le Petit Bistrot	Hospitality and service: 2	2017-02-12	Gratin Dauphinois;Tournedos Rossini;Brandade de morue	67.31	8	9	Lilou Gutiérrez	Avis mensonger

What a delightful place. Food was the star here and we were left literally grinning ear to ear by the end of it all. A feat considering how grumpy I was at prospect of consuming vegetarian food on account of Ganesh Chaturthy. But one sip of Vietnamese noodles soup later we were already celebrating. Halfway into Thai red curry/steamed rice I had already activated my man-vs-food mode but it all abruptly ended after my wife swiftly got everything parcelled.

Searched for Chinese cuisine nearby and I found this cuisine with better rating but with high costs. Thought of visiting this place and really it made my day.As soup is one of my favorite dishes I started with Spicy Crab soup.It was good but found something was missing in it.I tried to do some modifications and added sugar and venigar which made it awesome.Thai Basic chicken fried rice was good. Not that Spicy but I the rice was very dry. It might tasted better if it was bit wet.Betki fish tossed in crab meat was very good.That was a great experience with a great ambiance and good service.Food:3.5/5Ambiance:3.5Service:3.5	3.5	8/14/2016 22:37	recommandé	La Table d'Amis	Hospitality and service: 0	2017-08-07	Gratin Dauphinois;Poulet basquaise;Fondue savoyarde	31.46	18	21	Mélanie Wong	Avis mensonger

Initially thought of going to Wonton (Gachibowli) but on recommendation from a friend arrived here for dinner. Restaurant is located near the Gachibowli highway on the 1st floor above CCD. Restaurant had nice interiors and we were greeted in a warm manner. The staffs were very courteous to explain us the dish details at the time of order. We ordered for POTATO BALL HONEY PEPPER SA, DUMPLINGS, VEGETABLE MANCHURIAN, VEGETABLE BLACK BEAN NOODLES, 3 TREASURE VEG CHILLY. All Dishes were served spontaneously and all were almost authentic chinese dishes. There was no soup provided along with dumplings as is provided in Kolkata shops. We were disappointed with Manchurian as they were too much salty. Noodles were perfectly cooked but the babycorns needed to be boiled a bit. Overall a wonderful experience as we spent more than 2 hours eating n chitchatting with friends. We also had cakes which we brought from outside. They were very much cooperative to allow us outside food.TASTE 3.1/5SERVICE 5/5PRICE 4/5.

I was never a fan of Chinese food until I visited Chinese pavilion(Banjara hills). When I heard that they've opened a second branch in gachibowli I couldn't wait to visit.

I visited this restaurant with friends and was immediately blown away with the quality of service.We were seated immediately and the staff was courteous and professional especially with our large group.The ambience is one of the best I've come across with a rather unusually quirky ceiling piece.Food - I had the stuffed mushroom which was delicious along with a Fruit punch and a chocolate volcano.All in all one of the best culinary experiences I've had in the city.	5	6/15/2016 0:04	recommandé	La Maison du Pho	Hospitality and service: 3	2017-06-07	Bulgogi;Tom Yum	34.4	7	8	Océane Lin	Avis offensant

Chinese Pavilion in Banjara HIlls was the first Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad for me and I still have fond memories of the great authentic taste. So, when I heard that they have opened another restaurant in Gachibowli which is near to my home, I was excited and took my family to dinner. First of all, the ambience is a huge let down. It looked like any budget restaurant and I was thinking whether I should get out or go in. Finally, went in expecting some great food.We ordered noodles, fried rice, a lamb dish and a brownie. First of all, the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience. They are providing a 3* experience and asking for 4*/5* prices. The fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked. The desert was a disaster. Overall, please avoid this restaurant. I am not sure what is the condition of their Banjara Hills branch now but there are far better Chinese eateries around Gchibowli as well.	1.5	6/5/2016 10:49	déconseillé	La Brasserie Française	Hospitality and service: 0	2016-07-27	Galette complète;Galette complète	33.56	14	17	Louis Pérez	Avis mensonger
Madhumathi Mahajan Well to start with nice courteous servers and staff. Excellent serving time, all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out? These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out.Now food - Jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. Fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. Nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. Desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, I thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. So try and rate yourself.Last ambience - was warm n eye soothing.Oh and I forgot, the orange pekoe tea, the best I had in lat few months.

Bad rating is mainly because of Chicken Bone found in Veg food and is not acceptable for a Vegetarian.To satiate Cravings for chinese food we headed to Chinese Pavilion and there was also a voucher available in Little app for Luncheon tray for Rs 310 (Veg) [well do not bother for the voucher as the price for Veg Luncheon tray is Rs 275/- + taxes in the restaurant itself).The ambiance is decent and since it was noon, not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite.It was Thrusday special (Veg):Hot and Sour soup: was just OK - well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth: something different.Kimchi - salad (personally i'm never fond of it)Potato in plum sauce - this was very good and well madeBrocolli, Baby corn, Mushroom in spicy sauce - this dish lived to its name 'too spicy'; but was fine with fried riceVeg hakka noodles - was goodVeg fried riceOverall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken BONE came into my friend's (he is pure vegetarian) mouth while eating noodles. It was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined.Well Management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely don't want to visit the place again. I requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for Veg/Non-veg cooking which Manager declined which makes me believe they don't.Staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of Veg and Non-veg as in Indian Culture it means a lot.Uploaded photos with the bone found.	1.5	6/3/2016 10:37	déconseillé	Le Moulin à Vent	Hospitality and service: 0	2016-12-09	Pot-au-feu;Soufflé au fromage	29.4	8	10	Nolan Gutierrez	Avis mensonger
I personally love and prefer Chinese Food. Had been here couple of times with my husband.The ambiance of the place is very good. The entrance has some carvings and the walls were very nicely decorated. The server was very politeWhen it comes to food this place does not disappoint.This is a small/comfy restaurant that is surprisingly not very crowded even on weekends. We went there for our anniversary celebrations and it was just perfect. No crowd, we got the attention and service we were looking for.	4	5/31/2016 17:22	recommandé	Café Parisien	Hospitality and service: 1	2016-09-10	Salade Lyonnaise;Galette complète	42.17	9	11	Naomi Costa	Avis mensonger
Checked in here to try some delicious chinese food here, seen non-veg luncheon tray menu ans tried the same which they are charging 300+ taxes..Started with manchow soup and liked it instantly.. Thereafter luncheon tray had came with pepper chicken starter, kimchi (salad), wolly chicken, egg fried rice and egg hakka noodles.. Taste is fine and didn't liked eating egg hakka noodles and egg fried rice at a time.. Badly missed dessert along with tray!
